<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 7</span> ICILS IDE Walkthrough</h1>
<p>There are four general steps for exploring each IDE page (see exhibit 7-1). Each step is described in more detail in the following sub-sections.</p>
<p>Exhibit 7-1. What you will see in the IDE environment and what each step entails
<img src="images/chapter7/four-steps.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;width:100.0%" /></p>
<div id="select-criteria-4" class="section level2" number="7.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> 1. Select Criteria</h2>
<div id="a.-overview-16" class="section level3" number="7.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.1</span> 1.A. Overview</h3>
<p>Your data query in the ICILS IDE begins on the <strong>Select Criteria</strong>
screen (see exhibit 7-1).</p>
<p>Select a <strong>Display</strong> from the drop-down menu. Once the screen resets,
you can choose one or more <strong>Years</strong>, <strong>Measures</strong>, and
<strong>Jurisdictions</strong> for the data you wish to view or compare. Use the
<strong>Reset</strong> button, located in the upper-right portion of the screen (just
below the <strong>Help</strong> button), to cancel your selections and begin again.</p>
<p>Click on a blue sideways-facing arrow (►) to open up a category and
click on a blue downward‑facing arrow (▼) to close a category.</p>

Criteria tab.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="b.-choose-display" class="section level3" number="7.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.2</span> 1.B. Choose Display</h3>
<p>Under <strong>Display</strong>, you have the choice of <strong>Student</strong> and <strong>Teacher</strong>,
which corresponds to running either a student- or teacher-level
analysis. Selecting the Student option in the display drop-down list
provides student or school information that is an attribute of students
(with estimates reported, for example, as the “percentage of students”),
while selecting the Teacher option provides teacher or school
information that is an attribute of teachers (with estimates reported,
for example, in terms of the “percentage of teachers”). Once a display
is chosen, the screen resets and you can select <strong>Year</strong>(s),
<strong>Measure</strong>(s), and <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>(s).</p>
</div>
<div id="c.-choose-year-1" class="section level3" number="7.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.3</span> 1.C. Choose Year</h3>
<p>At the top of the <strong>Measure</strong> and <strong>Jurisdiction</strong> sections, you have
the choice of selecting 2018 and/or 2013 by checking the appropriate
box. To include data from both years, check the “All Years” box to the
left of the individual years. CIL data is available for both years, and
CT data is available for 2018.</p>
</div>
<div id="d.-choose-measure-1" class="section level3" number="7.1.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.4</span> 1.D. Choose Measure</h3>
<p>After choosing a display, you can choose one or more outcome variables
under Measure, including the overall scales for CIL or CT (Student
display only) and other continuous variables. These variables fall into
different categories. For example, the variable “Age of student” can be
found in the Student demographics category in the Student display, and
the variable “About You/ Year Teaching Started” can be found in the
Teacher demographics category in the Teacher display.</p>
<p>Some of the continuous variables may have missing values if there are
cases that did not answer the assessment or the questionnaire. In both
the Student and Teacher displays, selecting the variable “Percentage
across full sample” under the <em>Population</em> category will allow you to
calculate percentage statistics based on the full sample.</p>
</div>
<div id="e.-choose-jurisdiction-1" class="section level3" number="7.1.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.1.5</span> 1.E. Choose Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>With your <strong>Measure</strong>(s) and <strong>Year</strong>(s) selected, next choose at least
one <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>.</p>
<p>Jurisdictions are found under the following groups: <strong>Countries</strong> and
<strong>Benchmarking participants.</strong> There is also a group category called
<strong>Average</strong>, with options to display the <strong>Average of Countries</strong> and
the <strong>Average of the Selected Jurisdictions</strong>.</p>
<p>The general procedures for selecting one or more jurisdictions are as
follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To open or close jurisdictions, click on the arrow. Jurisdictions in
&gt; the group are open and can be selected when the blue arrow points
&gt; down (see exhibit 7-3).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the checkboxes next to the specific jurisdictions that you are
&gt; interested in or uncheck those jurisdictions that you wish to
&gt; deselect. If you click the checkbox next to the group name (e.g.,
&gt; “Countries”), you will select all the jurisdictions within that
&gt; group. If desired, uncheck the group name to deselect all.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to close a group (for example, close the list of
&gt; countries in order to readily see the Benchmarking participant
&gt; jurisdictions), click the blue arrow next to the group name. The
&gt; closed group’s arrow points to the right. Be advised that closing
&gt; the group will not deselect your choices.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.2</span> 2.B. Search Using Category and Sub Category Lists</h3>
<p>On the <strong>Select Variables</strong> screen, choose at least one variable for
your report. One way to do this is to search for variables using the
<strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Sub Category</strong> lists. If you don’t wish to choose
from any of the specified categories and subcategories, then select
<strong>All students</strong> in the <strong>All Students</strong> category.</p>
<p>The variables shown are tied to the criteria you selected at step 1
(<strong>Measure</strong>, <strong>Year</strong>, and <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>), which are indicated at
the top of the screen. To change any of these criteria, return to step
1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>.</p>
<p>To browse for variables, get details about them, select them, and view
them:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click <strong>details</strong> or <strong>hide details</strong> to show or hide the full title
&gt; of a given variable, the ICILS ID, and the values (i.e., value
&gt; labels). Note that some variables have the same or similar short
&gt; titles, but comparing details will show you how they differ. See
&gt; the example in exhibit 7-5, which shows two <strong>Immigration status</strong>
&gt; variables (SIMMIG and SIMMBGR). The differences between these two
&gt; variables are described in the details.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the checkbox next to a variable to select it for your

<p>The second way to search for variables is to use the <strong>Search</strong> function
on the <strong>Select Variables</strong> screen.</p>
<p>Type a term in the <strong>Search</strong> box and click <strong>Go</strong> (or hit “Enter” on
your keyboard) to find variables by keywords in the question and/or
details for the variable (see exhibit 7-6). If you use multiple keywords,
“and” is assumed. You can narrow your search by using “or,” “not,” or
“and not.” The search function operates on an exact phrase if it is
contained in quotes. The variable(s) that include the search term(s) in
the question or its details will be listed in the search results.</p>

<div id="edit-reports-4" class="section level2" number="7.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.3</span> 3. Edit Reports</h2>
<div id="a.-overview-18" class="section level3" number="7.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.1</span> 3.A. Overview</h3>
<p>You can access step 3, <strong>Edit Reports</strong>, after choosing criteria at step
1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>, and choosing variables at step 2, <strong>Select
Variables</strong>. The IDE will automatically build reports based on your
selections from steps 1 and 2. However, at step 3, you may modify your
selections for each report.</p>
<p>At this step, you can</p>
<ul>
<li><p>preview and edit the layout of your reports;</p></li>
<li><p>copy reports or create new reports based on the variables selected;</p></li>
<li><p>change formatting options, such as the number of decimal places to
display, for all reports (these may also be changed in individual
reports);</p></li>
<li><p>change statistics options, such as averages, for all reports (these
may also be changed in individual reports, but statistics options
can overwrite previous edits);</p></li>
<li><p>select reports to be built into tables and charts at step 4, <strong>Build
Reports</strong>; and</p></li>
<li><p>delete reports.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using your chosen criteria, the IDE will return a separate data report
for each variable you have chosen. If you have selected two or three
variables (not counting <strong>All Cases</strong>), you will also see a
cross-tabulated report for these variables. If you have chosen four or
more variables, you will get tables for each variable, but you won’t get
the cross-tabulation. If your selected criteria include more than one
measure (e.g., an overall scale and one or more continuous variables), a
separate set of data reports will be generated for each measure (see
exhibit 7-7).</p>

<p>The <strong>Edit Reports</strong> step shows overview information of your reports.
The <strong>Report</strong> column indicates the report, or cross-tabulation report,
number based on the variable(s) chosen during the criteria selection.
Under the <strong>All</strong> tab, reports may be chosen for the report-building
phase, either by selecting <strong>All</strong> or selecting individual reports. The
<strong>Action</strong> column gives you the option to <strong>Preview</strong>, <strong>Edit</strong>,
<strong>Delete</strong>, or <strong>Copy</strong> the report. The <strong>Measure</strong> column shows which
measure the report will portray. The <strong>Variable</strong> column indicates the
variable(s) included in the report. The <strong>Year</strong> column shows which
years you have selected for comparison. The <strong>Jurisdiction</strong> column
shows the countries and subnational education systems selected for
comparison, and the <strong>Statistic</strong> column provides the type of statistic
output that will be generated in the report-building phase.</p>

</div>
<p>A new variable that you create is applicable only to a specific report;
it does not apply to the other reports listed on the <strong>Edit Reports</strong>
screen. For example, if you selected multiple measures of the overall
scale CIL for analysis, then you would need to create the new variable
for each measure, or create a copy of the report and edit it
accordingly. To do the latter, click on <strong>Copy</strong> report on the <strong>Edit
Reports</strong> screen (see exhibit 7-7). The copied report will appear at the
end of the list of reports. Then, for the new copy, click on <strong>Edit</strong>
(using the above example, you can change the measure and give the report
a new name).</p>
<p>You can repeat the process and combine different values of a variable to
create additional new variables. Using the <strong>Create New Report</strong>
function, you can create a new report for each new variable that you
create. (For further information, see <strong>Section 3.E. Create New
Report</strong>, below.)</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.6</span> 3.F. Format Options</h3>
<p>From the main <strong>Edit Reports</strong> screen, clicking on <strong>Format Options</strong>
will allow you to make formatting changes applicable to all the reports
listed. The following formatting options are available using this
function (see exhibit 7-13):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Variable Labels (Long)</strong> displays a more detailed description of
&gt; the variables selected in a query than the default short label.
&gt; For variables from questionnaires, the full text of the question
&gt; is displayed. Be advised that the length of the extra detail may
&gt; sometimes interfere with table formatting.</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<ol start="18" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Show data for values categorized as “missing”</strong> will include the
&gt; percentage of students in the total sample or in a reporting group
&gt; for whom membership in a particular response category is unknown
&gt; because no response was given by the students, their teacher, or
&gt; their school. The percentage of “missing” will be shown in the
&gt; right-most table column. Missing data are available only for
&gt; queries that involve percentages as the statistic type. Unless you
&gt; check this option, the default is for missing responses not to be
&gt; included in the percentage distribution shown.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Year Order</strong> gives you the option to display either the most
&gt; recent year first or the oldest year first.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decimal Places</strong> allows you to specify the level of precision for
&gt; a particular statistic. Depending on the value range of the
&gt; dependent variable—for example, the dependent variable “ICILS
&gt; Computer and Information Literacy: Overall <span class="math display">\[PVCIL\]</span>” ranges from
&gt; 100 to 700; the dependent variable “Computer experience in years
&gt; <span class="math display">\[SEXCOMP\]</span>” ranges from 0 to 4—the default number of decimal
&gt; places for a report can vary from zero to three. Also, standard
&gt; errors will be shown to one more decimal place than is shown for
&gt; their respective statistic. For example, if you request that
&gt; average scores be displayed to one decimal place (by default,
&gt; average scores are rounded to the nearest whole number), the
&gt; corresponding standard errors will display two decimal places. If
&gt; you export to Excel, you will be able to increase the number of
&gt; decimal places in most cases. Note that only integer-level
&gt; precision is allowed for percentages; that is, the number of
&gt; decimal places is fixed at “none” for percentages, and the
&gt; corresponding standard errors are shown to one decimal place.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include</strong> gives you the option of showing standard errors. By
&gt; default, standard errors are shown inside parentheses, but you can
&gt; choose to show them without parentheses<em>.</em> You can preview the

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.3.7</span> 3.G. Statistics Options</h3>
<p>Available only from the main <strong>Edit Reports</strong> screen, clicking on
<strong>Statistics Options</strong> allows you to designate up to two statistics. The
selections you make are applicable to all the reports listed, although
you can also change the statistics for an individual report when you
edit it. (For further information, see <strong>Section 3.C. Edit Report</strong>.)</p>
<p>The following statistics options are available (see exhibit 7-14):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Averages.</strong> This statistic provides the average value for a
selected continuous variable or score (i.e., the overall scale for
CIL or CT). For the ICILS assessment, student performance is
reported on scales that range from 100 to 700. By default, the
standard errors of the scores are shown in parentheses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standard deviations.</strong> The standard deviation is a measure of how
widely or narrowly dispersed scores are for a particular dataset.
Under general normality assumptions, 95 percent of the scores are
within two standard deviations of the mean. For example, if the
average score of a dataset is 500 and the standard deviation is 100,
it means that 95 percent of the scores in this dataset fall between
300 and 700. The standard deviation is the square root of the
variance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Percentages.</strong> This statistic shows the percentage of students as
a row percentage. For example, if the first column lists countries,
then each country will display its own percentage distribution
across its row. By default, percentage distributions do not include
missing data. For information on how to show data for values
categorized as missing, see <strong>Section 3.F. Format Options</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Percentiles.</strong> This statistic shows the threshold (or cutpoint)
score for the following:</p>
<p>10<sup>th</sup> percentile – the bottom 10 percent of students</p>
<p>25<sup>th</sup> percentile – the bottom quarter of students</p>
<p>50<sup>th</sup> percentile – the median (half the students scored below the
cutpoint and half scored above it)</p>
<p>75<sup>th</sup> percentile – the top quarter of students</p>
<p>90<sup>th</sup> percentile – the top 10 percent of students</p></li>

<p>As previously noted, the selections you make in <strong>Statistics Options</strong>
will be applied automatically to all reports, although you can change
the statistics for an individual report when you edit it. Be advised
that if you use <strong>Statistics Options</strong> after editing the statistics in
one or more of your individual reports, the statistics options selected
will overwrite your previously edited selections. If you wish to use the
same criteria and variables in a report with a different selection of
statistics, consider using the <strong>Create New Report</strong> function to
generate a new report with different statistics. (For further
information, see <strong>Section 3.E. Create New Report</strong>.) You can also make
a copy of an individual report.</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>Reset</strong> button, located in the upper-right portion of
the main <strong>Edit Reports</strong> screen (just below the <strong>Help</strong> button), to
restore the <strong>Statistics Options</strong> to the default setting, which is
averages for all reports (this will also delete any new reports that you
created).</p>
<p>Not all statistics are available for all reports. Their availability
depends on other selections you have made to define the content and
format of your report:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Percentages will not display if jurisdictions or years appear in
columns.</p></li>
<li><p>If proficiency levels are selected in the variable section, only
average scores and percentages will be displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that results obtained from the IDE might not always match
those published by IEA or NCES. This is due to the use of different
reporting standards, such as suppression rules related to sample size
and suppression due to response rates.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.4.6</span> 4.F. Significance Tests</h3>
<p>Tests for statistical significance indicate whether observed differences
between estimates are likely to have occurred because of sampling error
or chance. “Significance” here does not imply any judgment about
absolute magnitude or educational relevance. It refers only to the
statistical nature of the difference and whether that difference likely
reflects a true difference in the population.</p>
<p>With your report of interest selected, click the <strong>Significance Test</strong>
link, which is located to the right of the <strong>Chart</strong> link (see exhibit
7-16), which will take you to the <strong>Significance Test</strong> window (exhibit
7-23). You first need to decide which variable you want to test and the
criterion by which you want to test it (i.e., between jurisdictions,
within variables, or across years). You will compare or look across the
variable’s range of values, so it must have more than one value. You can
look across jurisdictions for a variable (that is, compare between two
or more jurisdictions) or you can look across the values within a
variable for a single jurisdiction. For example, with the variable shown
in exhibit 7-23, you could choose to compare scores of female students
between countries and subnational education systems, or you could choose
to compare scores of female students and male students.</p>
<p>The general steps for running significance tests are as follows (see
exhibit 7-23):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the <strong>Significance Test</strong> window, select either <strong>Between
&gt; Jurisdictions</strong>, <strong>Within Variables</strong>, or <strong>Across Years</strong>. Then,
&gt; select the appropriate jurisdiction(s), variable(s), year(s), and
&gt; statistic(s). For <strong>Between Jurisdictions</strong>, select at least two
&gt; jurisdictions. For <strong>Within Variables</strong>, select at least two
&gt; variables. For <strong>Across Years</strong>, more than one year needs to be
&gt; selected.</li>

independent <em>t</em> tests with a linking error taken into account.</p>
<p>ICILS assessments are linked across years. That is, the sets of items
used to assess computer and information literacy (CIL) across years
include a subset of common items, referred to as link items. To
establish common reporting metrics for ICILS, the difficulty of the link
items, measured on different occasions, is compared. The comparison of
the item difficulties on the different occasions is used to determine a
score transformation that allows the reporting of the data on a common
scale. As each item provides slightly different information about the
link transformation, it follows that the chosen sample of link items
will influence the estimated transformation. The consequence is an
uncertainty in the transformation due to the sampling of link items,
just as there is an uncertainty in the country means due to the sampling
of students. The uncertainty that results from the link-item sampling is
referred to as the linking error, and this error must be taken into
account when making certain comparisons using the ICILS assessment data.
As with sampling errors, the likely range of magnitude for the errors is
represented as a standard error. Significance tests for scores across
years within the IDE take into account the linking errors applicable to
each display.</p>

<p>When the <strong>map option</strong> is selected, a global map is shown with the
countries and subnational education systems selected shaded in different
colors (see exhibit 7-25). The focal jurisdiction is shaded in teal green,
with all other countries compared to it. The other countries are shaded
in colors that indicate whether they are higher, lower, or not
significantly different from the focal jurisdiction on whatever measure
has been selected. (Note that a light shade of gray is the default color
for jurisdictions not selected for comparison.) When you hover over a
jurisdiction, a text bubble displays the numerical difference in
estimates between that jurisdiction and the focal jurisdiction. At any
point, you may choose a different focal jurisdiction by clicking on
another country. You may also choose a different variable category for
comparison by using the drop‑down menu above the map.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.4.7</span> 4.G. Gap Analysis</h3>
<p>Gap analysis is included in the IDE to compare differences in gaps shown
in a map, table, or chart. Gap differences can be compared between
jurisdictions and/or across years.</p>

</div>
<p>With your report of interest selected, click on the <strong>Gap Analysis</strong>
link, which is located to the right of the <strong>Significance Test</strong> link
(see exhibit 7-26). You will need to decide which variable you would like
to test (e.g., gender) and the criterion by which you want to test it
(i.e., between jurisdictions or across years). The difference measure,
or gap, can be viewed between groups, between years, between groups and
years, or between percentiles within the selected variable. For example,
if you compute average CIL scores for two countries at two time points
for males and females, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>at one time point, compare the male-female gap in one country to the
male-female gap in another country;</p></li>
<li><p>compare the male-female gap at two time points within a country;</p></li>
<li><p>compare the difference between the male-female gap at two time
points in one country to the difference between the male-female gap
at two time points in another country; or</p></li>
<li><p>compare the gap for females at two time points in one country to the
gap for females at two time points in another country.</p></li>

<div class="figcaption">Exhibit 7-27 is a screenshot from the ICILS IDE tool showing the gap

</div>
<p>The steps for running a gap analysis are similar to those for conducting
a statistical significance test (see exhibit 7-27). Thus, to run a gap
analysis, follow the instructions under <strong>Section 4.F. Significance
Tests</strong>, noting the following differences:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <strong>Gap Analysis</strong> link should be selected, not the <strong>Significance
&gt; Test</strong> link.</p></li>
<li><p>The gap analysis does not have a <strong>Within Variables</strong> option for
&gt; analysis; the options are <strong>Between Jurisdictions</strong> and <strong>Across
&gt; Years</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The difference measure (gap) of analysis must be selected from the
&gt; following: <strong>Between Groups</strong>, <strong>Between Years</strong>, <strong>Between Groups
&gt; and Years</strong>, and <strong>Between Percentiles</strong> (if variables are
&gt; selected for which a difference measure is not feasible, the
&gt; difference measure option will not appear as available in the Gap
&gt; Analysis menu).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The gap analysis output is presented in a format similar to that of the
significance test output, with one difference: the difference estimate
shown in the output is the difference between the gaps selected for
analysis. Note that you will still see the significance of these
differences, just like in a significance test. For example, exhibit 7-28
shows cross-national differences between male-female score gaps.</p>
<p>The gap analysis function computes and statistically tests differences
between score, percentage, or percentile gaps. For gap analysis tables,
all comparisons are independent tests with an alpha level of .05. Note
that the reference group for the gaps is kept constant during the
analysis, as opposed to taking the absolute value of the gaps.
Therefore, the gap analysis tests whether the magnitude of the gaps
differ from each other only when the gaps go in the same direction
(e.g., comparing a 5-point gender gap favoring females in one country
with a 15-point gender gap favoring females in another country).</p>

<p>Note that a gap analysis across years cannot be combined with the

will select the difference measure Between Groups, or, if you have
selected percentiles as one of your statistics, you may choose Between
Percentiles.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.4.8</span> 4.H. Regression Analysis</h3>
<p>Regression analysis is included in the IDE to test for the relationship
between one or more independent variables with a dependent variable,
with the independent variables controlling for each other. The type of
analysis performed in this feature of the IDE is referred to as linear
regression, with the dependent variable being a continuous variable
selected at step 1. To run a regression, first, go to <strong>Build Reports</strong>
and choose the report of interest from the drop-down <strong>Select Report</strong>
menu. Then click on the <strong>Regression Analysis</strong> link, which is to the
right of the <strong>Gap Analysis</strong> link (see exhibit 7-29).</p>

<div class="figcaption">Exhibit 7-29 is a screenshot from the ICILS IDE tool showing how to

</div>
<p>The general steps for running a regression analysis are as follows (see
exhibit 7-30):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the <strong>Regression Analysis</strong> pop-up window, you can enter a
<strong>Name</strong> limited to 25 characters, using only letters, numbers,
spaces, underscores, and hyphens (otherwise, by default, the test
will be named “Regression 1”).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the appropriate jurisdiction, year, and variable(s) for
analysis. Please note that you may only choose one jurisdiction and
year at a time, but you may choose up to three independent variables
to be in your report. In order to use up to three independent
variables, you must have already created and selected a
cross-tabulated report (by selecting three variables in Step 2,
<strong>Select Variables</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Preview</strong> tab located in the upper-left corner to view
the table format into which your output will be populated. In the
Preview tab, an “X” denotes where the output will display.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> tab in the upper-left corner of the screen if you
wish to go back and make changes to the selections you made for
running the analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Done</strong> button in the upper- or lower-right corner of the
screen to run the regression analysis.</p></li>

</div>
<p>After you have clicked <strong>Done</strong>, your regression analysis output will
load onto the screen (see exhibit 7-31). A 0-1 contrast coding is used to
code the independent variable, where the first subgroup of the
independent variable is the reference group. Using dummy-coded variables
in linear regression is useful for comparing each subgroup against a
reference group. For example, in exhibit 32, if the subgroup “Students
and/or at least one parent born in country of test” is the reference
group for the independent variable <strong>Immigration status (SIMMIG)</strong>, the
IDE creates a “Student born in country of test but both/only parent(s)
born abroad” dummy variable (1 if yes, 0 if no) and a “Student and
both/only parent(s) born abroad” dummy variable (1 if yes, 0 if no). The
reference group is excluded from the regression analysis.</p>

<div class="figcaption">Exhibit 7-31 is a screenshot from the ICILS IDE tool showing an example

</div>
<p>Using the output from the regression analysis, you can compare the
average CIL scores of first‑generation (Student and both/only parent(s)
born abroad) and second-generation (Student born in country of test but
both/only parent(s) born abroad) students to scores of native-born
(Students and/or at least one parent born in country of test) students.
When a single dummy‑coded variable is used in a regression, the
<em>intercept</em> is the mean of the reference group (e.g., 522.0007), and the
<em>regression coefficient</em> is the difference between the mean of the
reference group and the group identified (coded 1) with the dummy-coded
variable (e.g., −40.2344 for second generation and −20.0819 for first
generation). Since the regression coefficients are presented with a
standard error and a <em>t</em> value, they can be used to test whether a
difference between means is statistically significant. Under the
Significance column in the output, you will see three possible signs:
(1) &lt; signifies a significant negative difference, (2) &gt; signifies a
significant positive difference, and (3) x signifies the difference is
not statistically significant.</p>
