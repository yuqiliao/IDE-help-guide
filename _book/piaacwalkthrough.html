<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 4</span> PIAAC IDE Walkthrough</h1>
<p>There are four general steps for exploring each IDE page (see exhibit 3). Each step is described in more detail in the following sub-sections.</p>
<p>Exhibit 3. What you will see in the IDE environment and what each step entails
<img src="images/chapter5/four-steps.png" style="width:6.23643in;height:5.36138in" /></p>
<div id="select-criteria-1" class="section level2" number="4.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> 1. Select Criteria</h2>
<div id="a.-overview-4" class="section level3" number="4.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> 1.A. Overview</h3>
<p>Your data query in the PIAAC IDE begins on the Step 1. <strong>Select
Criteria</strong> screen (see exhibit 2, on next page).</p>
<p>Select a <strong>Display</strong> from the drop-down menus. Once the screen resets,
you can choose one or more of the years and studies or <strong>All
Years/Studies</strong>, <strong>Measures,</strong> and <strong>Jurisdictions</strong> for the data you
wish to view or compare. Use the <strong>Reset</strong> button, located in the
upper-right portion of the screen (just below the <strong>Help</strong> button), to
clear selections and start over.</p>
<p>Click on a blue sideways-facing arrow (►) to open up a category, and
click on a blue downward-facing arrow (▼) to close a category.</p>
<p>Exhibit 2. Selecting criteria</p>

<div id="b.-display" class="section level3" number="4.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.2</span> 1.B. Display</h3>
<p>Under <strong>Display</strong>, choose one of the three different NCES PIAAC IDE
adult sample populations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><u>U.S. Adults, 16–74 (Household and Prison)</u>:</strong> This
display contains U.S.-only comparable data from the PIAAC, including
the 2017 U.S. Household Data (for ages 16–74, and 16–65), combined
2012 and 2014 U.S. Household Data (for ages 16–74, and 16–65), and
Prison Data (for ages 16–74).</p>
<p><strong><u>Young Adults, 16–34</u></strong>: This display contains
internationally comparable data from the<br />
3 international rounds of PIAAC (2012–2017 for all countries, except
the U.S. which combined 2012–2014 data only) Household Data, ages
16–34. This display does not include the 2017 U.S. Household Data.</p>
<p><strong><u>Adults, 16–65</u></strong>: This display contains
internationally comparable data from the<br />
3 international rounds of PIAAC (2012–2017 for all countries, except
the U.S. which combined 2012-2014 data only) Household Data, ages
16–65. This display does not include the 2017 U.S. Household Data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once a display is chosen, the screen resets and you can select one or
more of the years and studies or <strong>All Years/Studies</strong>, <strong>Measure</strong>(s),
and <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>(s).</p>
</div>
<div id="c.-choose-yearstudys" class="section level3" number="4.1.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.3</span> 1.C. Choose Year/Study(s)</h3>
<p>In the same horizontal bar as the <strong>Measure</strong> and <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>
sections, you have the choice of selecting <strong>PIAAC 2017</strong> and/or <strong>PIAAC
2012/14</strong> by checking the appropriate box if the Display chosen is
<strong>U.S. Adults, 16–74 (Household and Prison)</strong>. You have the choice of
selecting <strong>PIAAC 2012–2017</strong>, <strong>ALL 2003–2008</strong>, and/or <strong>IALS
1994–1998</strong> if the <strong>Display</strong> chosen is <strong>Adults, 16–65</strong>, or <strong>Young
Adults, 16–34</strong>. To include data from all studies, check the <strong>All
Years/Studies</strong> box to the left of the individual year and study
options.</p>
</div>
<div id="d.-choose-measures" class="section level3" number="4.1.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.4</span> 1.D. Choose Measure(s)</h3>
<p>After choosing a <strong>Display</strong>, you can choose a <strong>Measure</strong> within the
<strong>Select Criteria</strong> tab. Note that the <strong><u>PIAAC overall
scales</u></strong> are the default and you can select more than one
overall scale although analysis for each scale will be done separately.
You can browse for other reporting scales using the <strong>Category</strong> and
<strong>Sub Category</strong> lists or by using the <strong>Search</strong> function.</p>
<p>There are a number of continuous variables other than scale scores that
you may choose as a measure of analysis. These variables are generally
continuous variables from the international and U.S. national background
questionnaires (such as earnings or hours of work per week) and derived
variables from PIAAC, ALL, and IALS. Derived variables from PIAAC
include indices of literacy, numeracy, and computer use at work and at
home and imputed years of formal education, among others. Analysis of
the continuous variables in terms of the continuous literacy, numeracy
and problem solving TRE scale scores is not possible, but it is possible
to analyze the continuous variables in terms of the literacy, numeracy,
and problem solving proficiency level variables available in the list of
<strong>Variables</strong>. For example, one cannot analyze the average number of
hours of work per week in relationship to score, but one can analyze the
average number of hours of work per week for adults at each proficiency
level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><u>Percentage across full sample</u></strong>: The adults in the
sample population that did not answer the assessment will be displayed
along with those that did answer the assessment if you select the
<strong>Percentage across full sample</strong> measure under the <strong>Population</strong>
category and <strong>Population</strong> subcategory.</p>
<p><strong><u>Reading components</u></strong>: There is a separate reporting
scale for the Reading Components domain of the PIAAC survey. The
Reading Components domain is used to measure literacy at the very low
end of the spectrum, with components such as sentence completion,
passage comprehension, and vocabulary. This domain was given to
respondents who decided not to take the computer-based assessment or
who did not pass a set of core information and computer technology
tasks and failed a set of core literacy/numeracy tasks.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div id="e.-choose-jurisdictions" class="section level3" number="4.1.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.5</span> 1.E. Choose Jurisdiction(s)</h3>
<p>With your <strong>Measure</strong>(s), one or more of the years and studies or <strong>All
Years/Studies</strong> selected, next choose at least one <strong>Jurisdiction.</strong></p>
<p>Jurisdictions are found under <strong>OECD National Entities</strong>, <strong>OECD
Sub-National Entities</strong> and <strong>Partners.</strong></p>
<p>There is also a group category called <strong>International</strong>, with options to
display the <strong>Average of All Jurisdictions</strong> and the <strong>Average of the
Selected Jurisdictions.</strong> Please note that selecting <strong>Average of All
Jurisdictions</strong> or <strong>Average of the Selected Jurisdictions</strong> increases
the frequency of receiving an error message in the <strong>Build Reports</strong>
step due to the high volume of information contained in these groups.</p>
<p>The general procedures for selecting one or more jurisdictions are as
follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To open groups of jurisdictions, click on the arrow (►).
Jurisdictions in the group are open and can be selected when the
blue arrow points down (▼) (see exhibit 3).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the checkboxes next to the specific jurisdictions that you are
interested in, or uncheck those jurisdictions that you wish to
deselect. If you click the checkbox next to the group name (e.g.,
“<strong>OECD National Entities</strong>”), you will select all the jurisdictions
within that group. If desired, uncheck the group name to deselect
all.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to close a group (for example, close the list of <strong>OECD
National Entities</strong> jurisdictions in order to readily see the <strong>OECD
Sub-National Entities</strong> jurisdictions), click the blue arrow
pointing down (▼) next to the group name. The closed group’s arrow
will now point to the right (►). Be advised that closing the group
will not deselect your choices.</p>
<p>NOTE: The U.S. Adults 16–74 (Household and Prison) Display only
includes data for the United States. The U.S. Household (16–74
years old), U.S. Prison (16–74 years old), and U.S. Household
(16–65) are the only selections available in the <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>
menu. However, users may choose to work with the U.S. prison sample,
or one of the U.S. household samples, or select more than one for
analysis as jurisdictions.</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.2.2</span> 2.B. Search Using Category and Sub Category Lists</h3>
<p>On the <strong>Select Variables</strong> screen, choose at least one variable for
your report. One way to do this is to search for variables using the
<strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Sub Category</strong> lists.</p>
<p>If you do not wish to choose from any of the specified categories and
subcategories, then select <strong><u>All adults</u></strong> in the <strong>Major
reporting groups</strong> sub category.</p>
<p>The variables shown are tied to the criteria you selected at step 1
(<strong>Measure,</strong> one or more of the years and studies or <strong>All
Years/Studies</strong> selected<strong>,</strong> and <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>), which are indicated
at the top of the screen. To change any of these criteria, return to
step 1, by clicking on <strong>Select Criteria</strong>.</p>
<p>To browse for variables, get details about them, select them, and view
them:</p>

<li><p>Click <strong>details</strong> or <strong>hide details</strong> to show or hide the full title
&gt; of a given variable, the PIAAC ID (e.g., GENDERR), and the values
&gt; (i.e., variable labels). Note that some variables have the same or
&gt; similar short titles, but comparing details will show you how they
&gt; differ. See the example in exhibit 5, which shows <strong>Last job -
&gt; Employee or self-employed</strong> and <strong>Last Job - Economic sector.</strong>
&gt; The differences between these two variables are described in the
&gt; details.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the checkbox next to a variable to select it for your

<p>The second way to search for variables is to use the <strong>Search</strong> function
on the <strong>Select Variables</strong> screen.  </p>
<p>Type a term in the <strong>Search</strong> box and click <strong>Go</strong> (or hit “Enter” on
your keyboard) to find variables by keywords in the question and/or
details for the variable (see exhibit 6). The search function operates
on whole words or on an exact phrase (if it is contained in quotes). To
search for less than a whole word or exact phrase, include an asterisk
(*) after the search term. If you use multiple keywords, “and” is
assumed. You can narrow your search by using “or,” “not,” or “and not.”</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.1</span> 3.A. Overview</h3>
<p>You can access step 3, <strong>Edit Reports,</strong> after choosing criteria at step
1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>, and choosing variables at step 2, <strong>Select
Variables</strong>. The IDE will automatically build reports based on your
selections from steps 1 and 2. However, at step 3, the <strong>Edit Reports</strong>
phase, you may modify your selections for each report. At this step, you
can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>preview and edit the layout of your reports;</p></li>
<li><p>copy reports or create new reports based on the variables selected;</p></li>
<li><p>change formatting options, such as number of decimal places to
display, for all reports (these may also be changed in individual
reports, but format options can overwrite previous edits);</p></li>
<li><p>change statistics options, such as average scale scores and
achievement levels, for all reports (these may also be changed in
individual reports, but statistics options can overwrite previous
edits);</p></li>
<li><p>select reports to be built into tables and charts at step 4, <strong>Build
Reports</strong>; and  </p></li>
<li><p>delete reports.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using your chosen criteria, the PIAAC IDE will return a separate data
report for each variable you have chosen. If you have selected two or
three variables (not counting <strong><u>All adults</u></strong>), you will
also see a <strong>cross-tabulated report</strong> for these variables. If you have
chosen four or more variables you will get tables for each variable, but
a cross-tabulation report will not be produced. If your selected
criteria include more than one <strong>Measure</strong> (e.g., overall literacy scale
and one or more continuous variable from step 1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>), a
separate set of data reports will be generated for each <strong>Measure</strong> (see
exhibit 7).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.4</span> 3.D. Create New Variables</h3>
<p>To create a new variable, select <strong>Edit,</strong> in the <strong>Action</strong> column, and
select <strong>Create new…</strong> under <strong>Variable</strong> (see exhibit 9). The new
variable is created by combining values for an existing variable. The
steps are as follows:</p>

</ol>
<!-- -->
<ol start="12" style="list-style-type: decimal">

used.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait for the screen to refresh, and press <strong>Done</strong>.</p></li>

</blockquote>
<ol start="15" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The new variable will appear in the <strong>Variable</strong> list in the <strong>Edit
Report</strong> window or <strong>Create New Report</strong> window, designated as
“collapsed.”</p></li>
<li><p>Check the box next to the new variable to view it in the report. You

<p>A new variable that you create is applicable <em>only</em> to a specific
report; it does not apply to the other reports listed on the <strong>Edit
Reports</strong> screen. For example, if you selected multiple measures of

for each measure, or create a copy of the report and edit it
accordingly. To do the latter, click on <strong>Copy</strong> report on the <strong>Edit
Reports</strong> screen (copied reports appear at the end of the list of
reports) and then, for the new copy, click on <strong>Edit</strong> (using the above
example, you can change the measure and give the report a new name). You
cannot save the new variable for reference or future use.</p>
<p>You can repeat the process and combine different values of a variable to
create additional new variables. Using the <strong>Create New Report</strong>

<p>If you selected two or three variables from which to create new
variables, you can repeat the process for each of them. Using the
<strong>Create New Report</strong> or <strong>Edit Report</strong> function, these collapsed
variables will be listed and available for cross-tabulation (see exhibit
11). If you have chosen four or more variables (not counting <strong>All

<p>From the main <strong>Edit Reports</strong> screen, clicking on <strong>Format Options</strong>
will allow you to make formatting changes applicable to all the reports
listed. The following formatting options are available using this
function (see exhibit 13):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><strong>Variable Labels (Long)</strong> displays a more detailed description of
the variables selected in a query than the default short label. For
variables from the background questionnaire, the full text of the

<li><p><strong>Show data for values categorized as “missing”</strong> will include the
percentage of adults in the total sample or in a reporting group for
whom membership in a particular response category is unknown because
no response was given by the adults. The percentage of “missing”
will be shown in the right-most table column. Missing data are
available only for queries that involve percentages as the statistic
type. Unless you check this option, the default is for missing
responses not to be included in the percentage distribution shown.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Year Order</strong> allows you the option to display the most recent year
first or the oldest year first.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decimal Places</strong> allows you to specify the level of precision for
a particular statistic. Depending on the value range of the
dependent variable (for example, the dependent variable “PIAAC
Literacy: Overall scale <span class="math display">\[PVLIT\]</span>” ranges from 0 to 1000; the
dependent variable “Index of use of ICT skills at home (derived)
<span class="math display">\[ICTHOME\]</span>” ranges from 0 to 4), the default decimal places for a
report could be from zero to three. Also, standard errors will be
shown to one more decimal place than is shown for a particular
statistic. For example, if you request that average scores be
displayed to one decimal place (by default, the average scores is
displayed to be the whole number), the corresponding standard errors
will be displayed to two decimal places. If you export to Excel, you
will be able to increase the number of decimal places in most cases.
Note that only integer-level precision is allowed for percentages;
that is, the number of decimal places is fixed at “none” for
percentages and the corresponding standard errors are shown to one
decimal place.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include</strong> gives you the option of showing standard errors. By

<div id="g.-statistics-options-1" class="section level3" number="4.3.7">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.3.7</span> 3.G. Statistics Options</h3>
<p>Available only from the main <strong>Edit Reports</strong> screen, clicking on
<strong>Statistics Options</strong> allows you to designate up to two statistics. The
selections you make are applicable to all the reports listed, although
you can also change the statistics for an individual report when you
edit it. (For further information, see <strong>Section 3.C. Edit Report</strong>.)</p>
<p>The following statistics options are available (see exhibit 14):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Averages.</strong> For the PIAAC assessment, adult performance is
reported on scales that range from 0 to 500. PIAAC reports the
average scale score for a variety of demographic samples of the
adult population (e.g., the average scale score in literacy for
female adults). Averages for other continuous variables are in the
same units as the variables themselves (e.g., average hourly
earnings for hourly earnings variable). By default, the standard
errors of the scale scores are shown in parentheses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Percentages.</strong> This statistic shows the percentage of adults as a
row percentage. For example, if the first column lists
jurisdictions, then each jurisdiction will display its own
percentage distribution across its row. By default, percentage
distributions do not include missing data. For information on how to
show data for values categorized as missing, see <strong>Section 3.F.
Format Options</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standard deviations.</strong> The standard deviation is a measure of how
widely or narrowly dispersed scores are for a particular variable.
Under general normality assumptions, 95 percent of the scores are
within two standard deviations of the mean. For example, if the
average value of a variable is 500 and the standard deviation is
100, it means that 95 percent of the values in this variable fall
between 300 and 700. The standard deviation is the square root of
the variance.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Percentiles.</strong> This statistic shows the threshold (or cutpoint)
for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>10<sup>th</sup> percentile—the bottom 10 percent of adults</p></li>
<li><p>25<sup>th</sup> percentile—the bottom quarter of adults</p></li>
<li><p>50<sup>th</sup> percentile—the median (half the adults scored below the
cutpoint and half scored above it)</p></li>
<li><p>75<sup>th</sup> percentile—the top quarter of adults</p></li>
<li><p>90<sup>th</sup> percentile—the top 10 percent of adults</p></li>

<p>As previously noted, the selections you make in <strong>Statistics Options</strong>
will be applied automatically to all reports, although you can change
the statistics for an individual report if you use the <strong>Edit</strong> command
in the <strong>Action</strong> column. Be advised that if you use <strong>Statistics
Options</strong> after editing the statistics in one or more of your individual
reports, the statistics options selected will overwrite your previously
edited selections. If you wish to use the same criteria and variables in
a report with a different selection of statistics, consider using the
<strong>Create New Report</strong> function to generate a new report with different
statistics. (For further information, see <strong>Section 3.E. Create New
Report</strong>.) You can also make a copy of an individual report.</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>Reset</strong> button, located in the upper-right portion of
the main <strong>Edit Reports</strong> screen (just below the <strong>Help</strong> button), to
restore the <strong>Statistics Options</strong> to the default setting, which is the
average for all reports (this will also delete any new reports that you
created).</p>
<p>Not all statistics are available for all reports. Their availability
depends on other selections you have made to define the content and
format of your report:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Percentages will not display if jurisdictions or years appear in
&gt; columns.</p></li>
<li><p>If proficiency levels are selected in the variable section, only
&gt; average scores and percentages will be displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the statistics produced by the IDE may not match the
statistics in reports published by the OECD or in the OECD PIAAC IDE,
due to differences in certain statistical standards. In particular, NCES
and the OECD may differ in the minimum sample sizes required for
publishing adult scores, as well as in the requirements for stability of
estimates for results to be reportable. For more details on the
differences in statistical standards, refer to the technical notes in
the NCES First Look report.[^1]</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.5</span> 4.E. Significance Tests</h3>
<p>Tests for statistical significance indicate whether observed differences
between assessment results are likely to have occurred because of
sampling error or chance. “Significance” here does not imply any
judgment about absolute magnitude or educational relevance. It refers
only to the statistical nature of the difference and whether that
difference likely reflects a true difference in the population.</p>
<p>With your report of interest selected, click the <strong>Significance Test</strong>
link, which is located to the right of the <strong>Chart</strong> link (see exhibit
22). You first need to decide which variable you want to test and the
criterion by which you want to test it (i.e., between jurisdictions,
within variables, or across years). You will compare or “look across”
the variable’s range of values, so it must have more than one value. You
can look across jurisdictions for a variable (that is, compare two or
more jurisdictions) or you can look across the values within a variable
for a single jurisdiction. Once the primary criterion is chosen, all
other criteria must be restricted to a single value.</p>
<p>The general steps for running significance tests are as follows (see
exhibit 23):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the <strong>Significance Test</strong> window, select <strong>Between
&gt; Jurisdictions</strong>, <strong>Within Variables</strong>, or <strong>Across Years</strong>. Then,
&gt; select the appropriate jurisdiction(s), variable(s), one or more
&gt; of the years and studies, and statistic(s). For <strong>Between
&gt; Jurisdictions</strong>, select at least two jurisdictions. For <strong>Within
&gt; Variables</strong>, select one or more jurisdictions. For <strong>Across
&gt; Years</strong>, more than one year/study needs to be selected.</li>
</ol>
<!-- -->
<ol start="21" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Enter a <strong>Name</strong> limited to 25 characters, using only letters,
&gt; numbers, spaces, underscores, and hyphens (otherwise, by default,
&gt; the test is named “Sig Test 1”).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the output type as either <strong>Table</strong> or <strong>Map</strong> or
&gt; <strong>Comparison</strong>. The table option will show the significance test
&gt; results as a matrix. The comparison option will show the

<p>When the table option is selected, you will get a significance test
matrix in which you will see the differences and <em>p</em> values. Using the
symbols shown in the legend of the matrix, an indication is also
provided of whether one estimate is significantly lower or higher than
another estimate or whether there is no significant difference (see
exhibit 24). Most comparisons are independent with an alpha level of
.05, except for within-jurisdiction comparisons on any given year, which
are dependent with an alpha level of .05. For example, gender
differences are treated as dependent samples with standard errors
computed taking this dependency into account.</p>

jurisdictions shaded (see exhibit 25). The focal jurisdiction is shaded
in teal green and represents a comparison for all the other
jurisdictions. The other jurisdictions are shaded in colors that
indicate whether they are higher, lower, or not significantly different
from the focal jurisdiction on whatever measure has been selected. (Note
that a light shade of gray is the default color for jurisdictions
categorized as “not selected for comparison.”) When you scroll over a
jurisdiction a text bubble pops up describing the difference between
that jurisdiction and the focal jurisdiction. At any point, you may
choose a different focal jurisdiction by selecting another jurisdiction
of your choosing. You may also choose a different variable category for
comparison by using the drop down menu above the map.</p>

<p>With your report of interest selected, click on the <strong>Gap Analysis</strong>
link, which is located to the right of the <strong>Significance Test</strong> link
(see exhibit 26). You will need to decide which variable you would like
to test (e.g., gender) and the basis to use for comparison (i.e.,
between jurisdictions or across years). The difference measure, or gap,
can be viewed between groups, between years, between groups and years,
or between percentiles within the selected variable. For example, if you
compute average literacy scores for two jurisdictions at two time points
for males and females, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>at one time point, compare the male-female gap in one jurisdiction
to the male-female gap in another jurisdiction;</p></li>
<li><p>compare the male-female gap at two time points within a

<li><p>compare the difference between the male-female gap at two time
points in one jurisdiction to the difference between the male-female
gap at two time points in another jurisdiction; or</p></li>

<li><p>The gap analysis does not have a <strong>Within Variables</strong> option for
analysis; the options are <strong>Between Jurisdictions</strong> and <strong>Across
Years.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The difference measure (gap) of analysis must be selected from the
following: <strong>Between Groups, Between Years, Between Groups and
Years,</strong> and <strong>Between Percentiles</strong> (if variables are selected for
which a difference measure is not feasible, the difference measure
option will not appear as available in the Gap Analysis menu).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The gap analysis output is presented in a format similar to that of the
significance test output, with one difference: the difference estimate
shown in the output is the difference between the gaps selected for
analysis. Note that you will still see the significance of these
differences just like in a significance test. For example, exhibit 28
shows the difference between jurisdictions in the average problem
solving in technology-rich environments score gap between males and
females.</p>
<p>The gap analysis function computes and statistically tests differences
between average value/score, percentage, or percentile gaps. Note that
the reference group for the gaps is kept constant during the analysis,
as opposed to taking the absolute value of the gaps. Therefore, the gap
analysis tests whether the magnitude of the gaps differ from each other
only when the gaps go in the same direction (e.g., comparing a 5-point
gender gap favoring females in one jurisdiction with a 15-point gender
gap favoring females in another jurisdiction).</p>

<p>NOTE: A gap analysis across years cannot be combined with the <strong>Between
Years</strong> or <strong>Between Groups</strong> and <strong>Years</strong> difference measures, so you
will select the difference measure <strong>Between Groups</strong>, or, if you have
selected percentiles as one of your statistics, you may choose <strong>Between
Percentiles</strong>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.7</span> 4.G. Regression Analysis</h3>
<p>Regression Analysis is included in the IDE to test for trends across
more than two data points. The type of analysis performed in this
feature of the IDE is referred to as linear regression within the field
of statistics.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 29. Regression analysis link selection</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/chapter5/image29.png" style="width:6.5in;height:2.10417in" /></p>
<p>A regression analysis can be performed based on the selections that were
made to build your table in the IDE by selecting the <strong>Regression
Analysis</strong> button above the table (see exhibit 29). The Measure, or
continuous variable, that you selected in Step 1 and that is displayed
in your table will automatically become your dependent variable for the
regression analysis (in exhibit 29 this is “PIAAC Literacy: Overall
scale”). Please note that continuous variables cannot be used as
independent variables. The variables that you selected in Step 2 and
that are displayed in your table will become your independent variable
options for the regression analysis (in exhibit 29 this is “About
yourself – Learning strategies – Relate to real life”).</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 30. Regression analysis options</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/chapter5/image30.png" style="width:6.48424in;height:3.52622in" /></p>
<p>The general steps for running a regression analysis are as follows (see
exhibit 30):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the <strong>Regression Analysis</strong> pop-up window, enter a <strong>Name</strong>
limited to 25 characters, using only letters, numbers, spaces,
underscores, and hyphens (otherwise, by default, the test will be
named “Regression 1”).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the appropriate jurisdiction, year, and independent
variable(s) for analysis. Please note that you may only choose one
jurisdiction and year at a time, but you may choose up to 3
independent variables to be in your report. In order to use up to 3
variables, you must have already created and selected a
cross-tabulated report (by selecting 3 variables in Step 2, <strong>Select
Variables</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Preview</strong> tab located in the upper-left corner to view
the table format into which your output will be populated. In the
Preview tab, an “X” denotes where the output will display.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> tab in the upper-left corner of the screen if you
wish to go back and make changes to the selections you made for
running the analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Done</strong> button in the upper- or lower-right corner of the
screen to run the regression analysis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After you have clicked <strong>Done</strong>, your regression analysis output will
load onto the screen (see exhibit 31). A 0-1 contrast coding is used to
code the independent variable, where the first subgroup of the
independent variable is the reference group. Using dummy-coded variables
in a linear regression is useful for comparing each subgroup against a
reference group. For example, in exhibit 31, if the subgroup “Not at
all” is the reference group for the independent variable <strong>About
yourself – Learning strategies – Relate to real life <span class="math display">\[IQ04B\]</span></strong>, the
IDE creates a “Very little” dummy variable (1 for respondents who
answered “Very little,” 0 otherwise), a “To some extent” dummy variable
(1 for respondents who answered “To some extent,” 0 otherwise), a “To a
high extent” dummy variable (1 for respondents who answered “To a high
extent,” 0 otherwise), and a “To a very high extent” dummy variable (1
for respondents who answered “To a very high extent,” 0 otherwise).</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 31. Regression analysis output</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/chapter5/image31.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.56667in" /></p>
<p>Using the output from exhibit 31 you can compare the average literacy
scores of adults who report “Not at all” to the background question to
average literacy scores of adults who report “Very little,” “To some
extent,” “To a high extent,” or “To a very high extent” to the
background question. When a single dummy-coded variable is used in a
regression, the <em>intercept</em> is the mean of the reference group (e.g.,
216.0766), and the <em>regression coefficient</em> is the difference between
the mean of the reference group and the group identified (coded 1) with
the dummy-coded variable (e.g., 14.8473 for adults who report “Very
little” to the background question). Since the regression coefficients
are presented with a standard error and a <em>t</em> value, these can be used
to test whether a difference between means is statistically significant.
Under the Significance column in the output you will see 3 possible
signs: 1) &lt; signifies a significant negative difference, 2) &gt;
signifies a significant positive difference, and 3) <em>x</em> signifies the
difference is not statistically significant.</p>

<p>Check the files you want to export and select one of the file formats:
<strong>HTML</strong> (print-friendly), <strong>Excel</strong>, <strong>Word</strong>, or <strong>PDF</strong> (see exhibit
32). All reports that you select at the same time will be exported in
one file. In the Excel format, you will be able to increase the decimal
places visible (wherever more precision is available in the database).
Because there are many different operating systems in use, you may get
an error message with Excel or one of the other formats. Usually, this
will not affect your ability to export, so please wait for the software
errors to resolve.</p>
