<p>Your data query in the PISA IDE begins on the <strong>Select Criteria</strong> screen
(see exhibit 2-2).</p>
<p>Select a <strong>Language</strong> from the drop-down menu and then select a
<strong>Subject</strong> from the drop-down menu. Once the screen resets, you can
choose one or more <strong>Years</strong>, <strong>Dependent Variables,</strong> and <strong>Jurisdictions</strong> for
the data you wish to view or compare. Use the <strong>Reset</strong> button, located
in the upper-right portion of the screen (just below the <strong>Help</strong>
button), to cancel your selections and begin again.</p>
<p>Click on a blue sideways-facing arrow (►) to open up a category and
click on a blue downward-facing arrow (▼) to close a category.</p>

<p>Under <strong>Subject</strong>, you have the choice of <strong>Mathematics, Reading, and
Science</strong>; <strong>Financial Literacy</strong>; <strong>Collaborative Problem Solving;
Problem Solving</strong>; <strong>Science (2003)</strong>; <strong>Science (2000)</strong>; or
<strong>Mathematics (2000)</strong>. Once a subject is chosen, the screen resets and
you can select <strong>Year</strong>(s), <strong>Dependent Variable</strong>(s), and <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>(s).</p>
<p>The PISA mathematics and science frameworks were revised in 2003 and
2006, respectively. Because of changes in the frameworks, it is not
possible to compare learning outcomes from PISA 2000 with those from
later cycles in mathematics and learning outcomes from PISA 2000 and
2003 with those from later cycles in science. Thus, mathematics data
from 2000 and science data from 2000 and 2003 appear separately in the
Subject dropdown.</p>

the choice of selecting 2022, 2018, 2015, 2012, 2009, 2006, 2003, and/or 2000
by checking the appropriate box. To include data from all years, check
the “All Years” box to the left of the individual years. Reading,
mathematics, and science data are available for all years. Currently,
problem-solving data are available for 2012, collaborative
problem-solving data are available for 2015, and financial literacy data
are available for 2012, 2015, 2018, and 2022.</p>

<p>After choosing a subject, you can choose between the overall scale
and/or any of the subject’s subscales. However, subscales are only
available for the subject area that was the major domain in a particular
year. Note that the overall scale is the default.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a number of continuous variables other than scale
scores that you may choose as a dependent variable of analysis. These variables
fall under different categories, such as Student and Family
Characteristics and School and Classroom Climate, and include variables
such as student age in years, size of class, and an index of computer
availability.</p>

<p>With your <strong>Dependent Variable</strong>(s) and <strong>Year</strong>(s) selected, next choose at least
one <strong>Jurisdiction.</strong></p>
<p>Jurisdictions are found under the following groups: <strong>OECD</strong>,
<strong>Non-OECD</strong>, and <strong>US States and Territories.</strong> There is also a group
category called <strong>International,</strong> with options to display the
<strong>International Average (OECD Countries)</strong> and the <strong>Average of the
Selected Jurisdictions.</strong></p>
<p>The general procedures for selecting one or more jurisdictions are as
follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To open or close jurisdictions, click on the arrow. Jurisdictions in
the group are open and can be selected when the blue arrow points
down (see exhibit 2-3).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the checkboxes next to the specific jurisdictions that you are
interested in, or uncheck those jurisdictions that you wish to
deselect. If you click the checkbox next to the group name (e.g.,
“OECD”), you will select all the jurisdictions within that group. If
desired, uncheck the group name to deselect all.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to close a group (for example, close the list of OECD
countries in order to readily see the non-OECD jurisdictions), click
the blue arrow next to the group name. The closed group’s arrow
points to the right. Be advised that closing the group will not
deselect your choices.</p></li>

<p>Step 2, <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong>, can only be accessed after choosing
criteria at step 1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>.</p>
<p>To continue your data query and edit a report, <em>you must choose at least
one variable on this screen.</em> You can browse for variables using the
<strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Sub Category</strong> lists or by using the <strong>Search</strong>
function (see exhibit 2-4). You can return to this screen to change
variable selections at any time.</p>

</h3>
<p>On the <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong> screen, choose at least one variable for
your report. One way to do this is to search for variables using the
<strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Sub Category</strong> lists. If you don’t wish to choose
from any of the specified categories and subcategories, then select
<strong>All cases</strong> in the <strong>All cases</strong> category.</p>
<p>The variables shown are tied to the criteria you selected at step 1
(<strong>Dependent Variable, Year,</strong> and <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>), which are indicated at the
top of the screen. To change any of these criteria, return to step 1,
<strong>Select Criteria</strong>.</p>
<p>To browse for variables, get details about them, select them, and view
them:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click the blue arrows to open and close categories and subcategories
of variables (see exhibit 2-5).</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>details</strong> or <strong>hide details</strong> to show or hide the full title
of a given variable, the PISA ID, and the values (i.e., value
labels). Note that some variables have the same or similar short
titles, but comparing details will show you how they differ. See the
example in exhibit 2-5, which shows two <strong>Grandparents</strong> variables
(SU002004 and SU012305). The differences between these two variables
are described in details.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the checkbox next to a variable to select it for your
analysis/report. You will see the count increase next to <strong>View
Selected</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>View Selected</strong> tab to see the variables you have
chosen. To return to the full list of variables by category, click
the <strong>View All</strong> tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to select the year for which you wish to build a report and
make sure that data are available for your chosen year and
variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Searching variables is an option from the <strong>Search</strong> box. See
Section Search Function for more details about this function.</p></li>

</div>
<p>When selecting <strong>Financial Literacy</strong> as the subject, additional student
questionnaire items about financial literacy will appear. These items address key areas related to
students’ experience and exposure to financial literacy including access
to information and education, access to money and financial products,
and spending and saving behaviors.</p>
<p>When you have selected the variable(s) you want to include, continue by
clicking the <strong>Edit Reports</strong> button at the bottom of the page or the

<p>The second way to search for variables is to use the <strong>Search</strong> function
on the <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong> screen.</p>
<p>Type a term in the <strong>Search</strong> box and click <strong>Go</strong> (or hit “Enter” on
your keyboard) to find variables by keywords in the question and/or
details for the variable (see exhibit 2-6). If you use multiple keywords,
“and” is assumed. You can narrow your search by using “or,” “not,” or
“and not.” The search function operates on an exact phrase if it is
contained in quotes. The variable(s) that include the search term(s) in
the question or its details will be listed.</p>

</div>
<p>When you have selected the variable(s) you want to include, continue by

<p>You can access step 3, <strong>Edit Reports,</strong> after choosing criteria at step
1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>, and choosing variables at step 2, <strong>Select
Variables</strong>. The IDE will automatically build reports based on your
selections from steps 1 and 2. However, at step 3, the <strong>Edit Reports</strong>
phase, you may modify your selections for each report.</p>
<p>At this step, you can</p>
<ul>
<li><p>preview and edit the layout of your reports;</p></li>
<li><p>copy reports or create new reports based on the variables selected;</p></li>
<li><p>change formatting options, such as the number of decimal places to
display, for all reports (these may also be changed in individual
reports, but format options can overwrite previous edits);</p></li>
<li><p>change statistics options, such as averages, for all reports (these
may also be changed in individual reports, but statistics options
can overwrite previous edits);</p></li>
<li><p>select reports to be built into tables and charts at step 4, <strong>Build
Reports</strong>; and  </p></li>
<li><p>delete reports.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using your chosen criteria, the IDE will return a separate data report
for each variable you have chosen. If you have selected two or three
variables (not counting <strong>All cases</strong>), you will also see a
cross-tabulated report for these variables. If you have chosen four or
more variables you will get tables for each variable, but you won’t get
the cross-tabulation. If your selected criteria include more than one
dependent variable (e.g., overall mathematics scale and one or more subscale or
continuous variable), a separate set of data reports will be generated
for each dependent variable (see exhibit 2-7).</p>
<div class="inline-figure">Exhibit 2-7. Edit reports overview

</div>
<p>The <strong>Edit Reports</strong> step shows detailed information on the layout of
your reports. The <strong>Report</strong> column indicates the report, or
cross-tabulation report, number based on the variable(s) chosen during
the criteria selection. Under the <strong>All</strong> tab, reports may be chosen for
the report-building phase, either by selecting <strong>All</strong> or selecting
individual reports. The <strong>Action</strong> column gives you the option to
<strong>Preview</strong>, <strong>Edit, Delete</strong>, or <strong>Copy</strong> the report. The <strong>Dependent Variable</strong>
column shows which dependent variable the report will portray. The <strong>Grouping Variable</strong>
column indicates the variable(s) included in the report. The <strong>Year</strong>
column shows which years you have selected for comparison. The
<strong>Jurisdiction</strong> column shows the countries and subnational education
systems selected for comparison, and the <strong>Statistic</strong> column provides
the type of statistic output that will be generated in the
report-building phase.</p>

</div>
<p>A new variable that you create is applicable only to a specific report;
it does not apply to the other reports listed on the <strong>Edit Reports</strong>
screen. For example, if you selected multiple dependent variables of science
literacy for analysis, then you would need to create the new variable
for each dependent variable, or create a copy of the report and edit it
accordingly. To do the latter, click on <strong>Copy</strong> report on the <strong>Edit
Reports</strong> screen (copied reports appear at the end of the list of
reports) and then, for the new copy, click on <strong>Edit</strong> (using the above
example, you can change the dependent variable and give the report a new name).</p>
<p>You can repeat the process and combine different values of a variable to
create additional new variables. Using the <strong>Create New Report</strong>
function, you can create a new report for each new variable that you
create. (For further information, see section Create New Report,
below.)</p>
<p>If you selected two or three variables from which to create new
variables, you can repeat the process for each of them. Using the
<strong>Create New Report</strong> or <strong>Edit Report</strong> function, these collapsed
variables will be listed and available for cross-tabulation (see exhibit
2-11). If you have chosen four or more variables (not counting <strong>All Cases</strong>) you won’t get the cross-tabulation. You can click
<strong>Preview</strong> to see how the table will be laid out before retrieving
data.</p>

<p>From the main <strong>Edit Reports</strong> screen, clicking on <strong>Format Options</strong>
will allow you to make formatting changes applicable to all the reports
listed. The following formatting options are available using this
function (see exhibit 2-13):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Variable Labels (Long)</strong> displays a more detailed description of
the variables selected in a query than the default short label. For
variables from questionnaires, the full text of the question is
displayed. Be advised that the length of the extra detail may
sometimes interfere with table formatting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Show data for values categorized as “missing”</strong> will include the
percentage of students in the total sample or in a reporting group
for whom membership in a particular response category is unknown
because no response was given by the students, their teacher, or
their school. The percentage of “missing” will be shown in the
right-most table column. Missing data are available only for queries
that involve percentages as the statistic type. Unless you check
this option, the default is for missing responses not to be included
in the percentage distribution shown.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decimal Places</strong> allows you to specify the level of precision for
a particular statistic. Depending on the value range of the
dependent variable (for example, the dependent variable “PISA
Mathematics Scale: Overall Mathematics [PVMATH]” ranges from 0 to
1,000; the dependent variable “Index economic, social and cultural
status [ESCS15]” ranges from -5 to 5), the default decimal places
for a report could be from zero to three. Also, standard errors will
be shown to one more decimal place than is shown for their
respective statistic. For example, if you request that average
scores be displayed to one decimal place (by default, the average
scores are rounded to the nearest whole number), the corresponding
standard errors will display two decimal places. If you export to
Excel, you will be able to increase the number of decimal places in
most cases. Note that only integer-level precision is allowed for
percentages; that is, the number of decimal places is fixed at
“none” for percentages and the corresponding standard errors are
shown to one decimal place.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include</strong> gives you the option of showing standard errors. By
default, standard errors are shown inside parentheses, but you can
choose to show them without parentheses<em>.</em> You can preview the
effects of your selection in the <strong>Sample Display</strong> area (see the
blue-shaded box at the bottom of exhibit 2-13 below).</p></li>

<strong>Statistics Options</strong> allows you to designate up to two statistics. The
selections you make are applicable to all the reports listed, although
you can also change the statistics for an individual report when you
edit it. (For further information, see Section Edit Report.)</p>
<p>The following statistics options are available (see exhibit 2-14):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Averages.</strong> This statistic provides the average value for a
selected continuous variable or score (i.e., overall score or
subscale score). For the PISA assessment, student performance is
reported on scales that range from 0 to 1,000. By default, the
standard errors of the scores are shown in parentheses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Percentages.</strong> This statistic shows the percentage of students as
a row percentage. For example, if the first column lists countries,
then each country will display its own percentage distribution
across its row. By default, percentage distributions do not include
missing data. For information on how to show data for values
categorized as missing, see Section Format Options.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standard deviations.</strong> The standard deviation is a dependent variable of how
widely or narrowly dispersed scores are for a particular dataset.
Under general normality assumptions, 95 percent of the scores are
within two standard deviations of the mean. For example, if the
average score of a dataset is 500 and the standard deviation is 100,
it means that 95 percent of the scores in this dataset fall between
300 and 700. The standard deviation is the square root of the
variance.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Percentiles.</strong> This statistic shows the threshold (or cutpoint)
score for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>10<sup>th</sup> percentile – the bottom 10 percent of students</p></li>
<li><p>25<sup>th</sup> percentile – the bottom quarter of students</p></li>
<li><p>50<sup>th</sup> percentile – the median (half the students scored below
the cutpoint and half scored above it)</p></li>
<li><p>75<sup>th</sup> percentile – the top quarter of students</p></li>

<p>As previously noted, the selections you make in <strong>Statistics Options</strong>
will be applied automatically to all reports, although you can change
the statistics for an individual report when you edit it. Be advised
that if you use <strong>Statistics Options</strong> after editing the statistics in

<p>Please note that the statistics produced by the IDE may not match the
statistics in reports published by the OECD due to differences in
certain statistical standards. In particular, NCES and the OECD may
differ in the minimum sample sizes required for publishing estimates. In
the IDE, statistics for a group are suppressed if they are based on less
than 62 cases. In the OECD reports, statistics are suppressed if there
are fewer than 30 students or fewer than 5 schools with valid data.</p>

<p>Tests for statistical significance indicate whether observed differences
between estimates are likely to have occurred because of sampling error
or chance. “Significance” here does not imply any judgment about
absolute magnitude or educational relevance. It refers only to the
statistical nature of the difference and whether that difference likely
reflects a true difference in the population.</p>
<p>With your report of interest selected, click the <strong>Significance Test</strong>
link, which is located to the right of the <strong>Chart</strong> link (see exhibits
2-16). You first need to decide which variable you want to test and
the criterion by which you want to test it (i.e., between jurisdictions,
within variables, or across years). You will compare or look across the
variable’s range of values, so it must have more than one value. You can
look across jurisdictions for a variable (that is, compare between two
or more jurisdictions) or you can look across the values within a
variable for a single jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The general steps for running significance tests are as follows (see
exhibit 2-23):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the <strong>Significance Test</strong> window, select either <strong>Between
Jurisdictions</strong>, <strong>Within Grouping Variables</strong>, or <strong>Across Years</strong>. Then,
select the appropriate jurisdiction(s), variable(s), year(s), and
statistic(s). For <strong>Between Jurisdictions</strong>, select at least two
jurisdictions. For <strong>Within Grouping Variables</strong>, select one or more
jurisdictions. For <strong>Across Years</strong>, more than one year needs to be
selected.</p></li>
<li><p>You can enter a <strong>Test Title</strong> limited to 25 characters, using only
letters, numbers, spaces, underscores, and hyphens (otherwise, by
default, the test is named “Sig Test 1”).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the output type as either <strong>Table</strong> or <strong>Map</strong>. The table
option will show the significance test results as a matrix. The map
option will show the significance test results on a world map,
highlighting countries and subnational education systems that have
been selected. The map output is only available when <strong>Between
Jurisdictions</strong> is selected in the first step.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional options allow you to select <strong>Show Score Details</strong> to
display the estimates and standard errors for the table cells. If
you selected a map, this option is not applicable, as the map will
automatically show score details.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Preview</strong> tab located in the upper-left corner, or the
<strong>Preview</strong> button located in the bottom-left corner.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> tab in the upper-left corner of the screen if you
wish to go back and make changes to the selections you made for
running the significance tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Done</strong> button in the upper- or lower-right corner of the

</div>
<p>When the table option is selected, you will get a significance test
matrix in which you will see the differences and <em>p</em> values. Using the
symbols shown in the legend of the matrix, an indication is also
provided of whether one estimate is significantly lower or higher than
another estimate or whether there is no significant difference (see
exhibit 2-24).</p>
<p>The alpha level for all <em>t</em>-tests is .05. All comparisons within a jurisdiction, within the same year, are made using dependent <em>t</em>-tests. Comparisons between jurisdictions are treated as independent. Non-achievement comparisons across years are treated as independent. Comparisons of achievement across years are made using independent <em>t</em>-tests with a linking error taken into account. A part-whole adjustment is implemented for comparisons between a jurisdiction and a group that the jurisdiction is part of (e.g. International Average (OECD Countries)).</p>
<p>PISA assessments are linked across years. That is, the sets of items
used to assess mathematics, reading, and science across years include a
subset of common items, referred to as link items. To establish common
reporting metrics for PISA, the difficulty of the link items, measured
on different occasions, is compared. The comparison of the item
difficulties on the different occasions is used to determine a score
transformation that allows the reporting of the data on a common scale.
As each item provides slightly different information about the link
transformation, it follows that the chosen sample of link items will
influence the estimated transformation. The consequence is an
uncertainty in the transformation due to the sampling of link items,
just as there is an uncertainty in country means due to the sampling of
students. The uncertainty that results from the link-item sampling is
referred to as linking error, and this error must be taken into account
when making certain comparisons using the PISA assessment data. As with
sampling errors, the likely range of magnitude for the errors is
represented as a standard error. Significance tests for scores across
years within the IDE take into account the linking errors applicable to
each subject.</p>

countries compared to it. The other countries are shaded in colors that
indicate whether they are higher, lower, or not significantly different
from the focal jurisdiction on whatever dependent variable has been selected. (Note
that a light shade of gray is the default color for jurisdictions not
selected for comparison.) When you hover over a jurisdiction, a text
bubble displays the numerical difference in estimates between that
jurisdiction and the focal jurisdiction. At any point, you may choose a
different focal jurisdiction by clicking on another country. You may
also choose a different variable category for comparison by using the
drop-down menu above the map.</p>

<p>Please note that the IDE does not apply adjustments for multiple
comparisons. This is consistent with current NCES statistical standards
and practice. However, the U.S. PISA 2000 national report published by
NCES, and the PISA 2000 international report published by the OECD, did
adjust for multiple comparisons in significance testing (using the
Bonferroni method). Therefore, results from significance testing
obtained from the IDE may not match those in the NCES and OECD PISA 2000
reports.</p>

</h3>
<p>Gap Analysis is included in the IDE to compare differences in gaps shown
in a map, table, or chart. These gap differences can be compared between
jurisdictions and/or across years.</p>
<div class="inline-figure">Exhibit 2-26. Gap analysis link selection

</div>
<p>With your report of interest selected, click on the <strong>Gap Analysis</strong>
link, which is located to the right of the <strong>Significance Test</strong> link
(see exhibit 2-26). You will need to decide which variable you would like
to test (e.g., gender) and the criterion by which you want to test it
(i.e., between jurisdictions or across years). The difference measure,
or gap, can be viewed between groups, between years, between groups and
years, or between percentiles within the selected variable. For example,
if you compute average mathematics literacy scores for two countries at
two time points for males and females, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>at one time point, compare the male-female gap in one country to the
male-female gap in another country;</p></li>
<li><p>compare the male-female gap at two time points within a country;</p></li>
<li><p>compare the difference between the male-female gap at two time
points in one country to the difference between the male-female gap
at two time points in another country; or</p></li>
<li><p>compare the gap for females at two time points in one country to the
gap for females at two time points in another country.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>The steps for running a gap analysis are similar to those for conducting
a statistical significance test (see exhibit 2-27). Thus, to run a gap
analysis, follow the instructions under section Significance
Tests, noting the following differences:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <strong>Gap Analysis</strong> link should be selected, not the <strong>Significance
Test</strong> link.</p></li>
<li><p>The gap analysis does not have a <strong>Within Grouping Variables</strong> option for
analysis; the options are <strong>Between Jurisdictions</strong> and <strong>Across
Years.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The difference measure (gap) of analysis must be selected from the
following: <strong>Between Groups, Between Years, Between Groups and
Years,</strong> and <strong>Between Percentiles</strong> (if variables are selected for
which a difference measure is not feasible, the difference measure
option will not appear as available in the Gap Analysis menu).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The gap analysis output is presented in a format similar to that of the
significance test output, with one difference: the difference estimate
shown in the output is the difference between the gaps selected for
analysis. Note that you will still see the significance of these
differences, just like in a significance test. For example, exhibit 2-28
shows cross-national differences between male-female score gaps.</p>
<p>The gap analysis function computes and statistically tests differences
between score, percentage, or percentile gaps. For gap analysis tables,
all comparisons are independent tests with an alpha level of 0.05. Note
that the reference group for the gaps is kept constant during the
analysis, as opposed to taking the absolute value of the gaps.
Therefore, the gap analysis tests whether the magnitude of the gaps
differ from each other only when the gaps go in the same direction
(e.g., comparing a 5-point gender gap favoring females in one country
with a 15-point gender gap favoring females in another country).</p>

</div>
<p>Note that a gap analysis across years cannot be combined with the
Between Years or Between Groups and Years difference measures, so you
will select the difference measure Between Groups, or, if you have
selected percentiles as one of your statistics, you may choose Between
Percentiles.</p>

</h3>
<p>Regression Analysis is included in the IDE to test for the relationship
between one or more independent variables with a dependent variable,
with the independent variables controlling for each other. The type of
analysis performed in this feature of the IDE is referred to as linear
regression, with the dependent variable being a continuous variable
selected at step 1. To run a regression, first go to <strong>Build Reports</strong>
and choose the report of interest from the drop-down <strong>Select Report</strong>
menu. Then click on the <strong>Regression Analysis</strong> link, which is to the
right of the <strong>Gap Analysis</strong> link (see exhibit 2-29).</p>

</div>
<p>The general steps for running a regression analysis are as follows (see
exhibit 2-30):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the <strong>Regression Analysis</strong> pop-up window, you can enter a
<strong>Name</strong> limited to 25 characters, using only letters, numbers,
spaces, underscores, and hyphens (otherwise, by default, the test
will be named “Regression 1”).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the appropriate jurisdiction, year, and variable(s) for
analysis. Please note that you may only choose one jurisdiction and
year at a time, but you may choose up to three independent variables
to be in your report. In order to use up to three independent
variables, you must have already created and selected a
cross-tabulated report (by selecting three variables in Step 2,
<strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Preview</strong> tab located in the upper-left corner to view
the table format into which your output will be populated. In the
Preview tab, an “X” denotes where the output will display.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> tab in the upper-left corner of the screen if you
wish to go back and make changes to the selections you made for
running the analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Done</strong> button in the upper- or lower-right corner of the
screen to run the regression analysis.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="inline-figure">Exhibit 2-30. Regression analysis options

</div>
<p>After you have clicked <strong>Done</strong>, your regression analysis output will
load onto the screen (see exhibit 2-31). A 0-1 contrast coding is used to
code the independent variable, where the first subgroup of the
independent variable is the reference group. Using dummy-coded variables
in a linear regression is useful for comparing each subgroup against a
reference group. For example, in exhibit 2-31, if the subgroup “Native” is
the reference group for the independent variable <strong>Index immigration
status (IMMIG)</strong>, the IDE creates a “Second Generation” dummy variable
(1 for respondents who answered “Second Generation,” 0 otherwise), a
“First Generation” dummy variable (1 for respondents who answered “First
Generation,” 0 otherwise). Reference group “Native” is excluded from the
regression analysis.</p>
<div class="inline-figure">Exhibit 2-31. Regression analysis output

</div>
<p>Using the output from exhibit 2-31, you can compare the average
mathematics literacy scores of first- and second-generation students to
scores of native-born students. When a single dummy-coded variable is
used in a regression, the <em>intercept</em> is the mean of the reference group
(e.g., 469.9625), and the <em>regression coefficient</em> is the difference
between the mean of the reference group and the group identified
(coded 1) with the dummy-coded variable (e.g., -4.3027 for second
generation and -28.8162 for first generation.) Since the regression
coefficients are presented with a standard error and a <em>t</em> value, they
can be used to test whether a difference between means is statistically
significant. Under the Significance column in the output you will see
three possible signs: (1) &lt; signifies a significant negative
difference, (2) &gt; signifies a significant positive difference, and (3)
x signifies the difference is not statistically significant.</p>
