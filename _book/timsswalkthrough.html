<p>After choosing a subject, you can choose between the overall scale and/or any of the subject’s
subscales. The overall scale and subscales can be used for trend analyses across years where
applicable.
In addition, there are a number of continuous variables other than scale scores that you may
choose as a dependent variable of analysis. These variables fall under different categories, such as “Student
and Family Characteristics” and “Teacher Background Characteristics, Formal Education, and
Training” and include variables such as age, teaching experience, and class size.</p>

<p>With your <strong>Dependent Variable</strong>(s) and <strong>Year</strong>(s) selected, next choose at least
one <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>.</p>
<p>Jurisdictions are found under the following groups: <strong>Countries</strong>, <strong>U.S. Jurisdictions</strong>, and
<strong>Benchmarking Participants</strong>. There is also a group category called <strong>Average</strong>, with options to
display the <strong>Average of Countries</strong> and the <strong>Average of Selected Countries/Participants</strong>.
<strong>Average of Countries</strong> displays the average statistic for all available jurisdictions under the
“<strong>Countries</strong>” group, except when “<strong>All cases</strong>” is selected at step 2, in which case <strong>Average of
Countries</strong> displays the TIMSS scale centerpoint of 500.</p>
<p>The general procedures for selecting one or more jurisdictions are as
follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To open or close jurisdictions, click on the arrow. Jurisdictions in
the group are open and can be selected when the red arrow points
down (see exhibit 4-3).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the checkboxes next to the specific jurisdictions that you are
interested in, or uncheck those jurisdictions that you wish to
deselect. If you click the checkbox next to the group name (e.g.,
“Countries”), you will select all the jurisdictions within that
group. If desired, uncheck the group name to deselect all.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to close a group (e.g., close the list of countries in
order to readily see the benchmarking participants), click the red
arrow next to the group name. The closed group’s arrow points to the
right. Be advised that closing the group will not deselect your
choices.</p></li>

</h3>
<p>On the <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong> screen, choose at least one variable for
your report. One way to do this is to search for variables using the
<strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Sub Category</strong> lists. If you don’t wish to choose
from any of the specified categories and subcategories, select <strong>All Cases</strong> in the <strong>Total</strong> category.</p>
<p>The variables shown are tied to the criteria you selected at step 1 (<strong>Subject</strong>, <strong>Grade</strong>, <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>,
<strong>Dependent Variable</strong>, and <strong>Year</strong>), which are indicated at the top of the screen. To change any of these
criteria, return to step 1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>.</p>
<p>To browse for variables, get details about them, select them, and view
them:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click the red arrows to open and close categories and subcategories
of variables (see exhibit 4-5).</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>details</strong> or <strong>hide details</strong> to show or hide the full title
of a given variable, the TIMSS ID, and the values (i.e., value
labels). Note that some variables have the same or similar short
titles, but comparing details will show you how they differ. See the
example in exhibit 4-5 below, which shows two variables titled
<strong>Gen\speak language of test at home</strong>. “Gen” refers to variables
that are general cross-subject variables. The differences between
these two variables are described in the details.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the checkbox next to a variable to select it for your
analysis/report. You will see the count increase next to <strong>View
Selected</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>View Selected</strong> tab to see the variables you have
chosen. To return to the full list of variables by category, click
the <strong>View all</strong> tab.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to select the year for which you wish to build a report and
make sure that data are available for your chosen year and
variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Searching variables is an option from the <strong>Search</strong> box. See
Section Search Function for more details about this function.</p></li>

on the <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong> screen.</p>
<p>Type a term in the <strong>Search</strong> box and click <strong>Go</strong> (or hit “Enter” on
your keyboard) to find variables by keywords in the question and/or
details for the variable (see exhibit 4-6). If you use multiple keywords,
“and” is assumed. You can narrow your search by using “or,” “not,” or
“and not.” The search function operates on an exact phrase if it is contained in quotes. The variable(s) that
include the search term(s) in the question or its details will be listed.</p>

<p>You can access step 3, <strong>Edit Reports,</strong> after choosing criteria at step
1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>, and choosing variables at step 2, <strong>Select
Variables</strong>. The IDE will automatically build reports based on your
selections from steps 1 and 2. However, at step 3, the <strong>Edit Reports</strong>
phase, you may modify your selections for each report.</p>
<p>At this step, you can</p>
<ul>
<li>preview and edit the layout of your reports;</li>
<li>copy reports or create new reports based on the variables selected;</li>
<li>change formatting options, such as number of decimal places to
display, for all reports (these may also be changed in individual
reports, but format options can overwrite previous edits);</li>
<li>change statistics options, such as averages, for all reports (these
may also be changed in individual reports, but statistics options
can overwrite previous edits);</li>
<li>select reports to be built into tables and charts at step 4, <strong>Build
Reports</strong>; and<br>
</li>
<li>delete reports.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using your chosen criteria, the IDE will return a separate data report
for each variable you have chosen. If you have selected two or three
variables (not counting <strong>All cases</strong>), you will also see a
cross-tabulated report for these variables. If you have chosen four or
more variables, you will get tables for each variable, but you will not
get the cross-tabulation. If your selected criteria include more than
one dependent variable (e.g., overall science scale and one or more science
subscales or continuous variables), a separate set of data reports will
be generated for each dependent variable (see exhibit 4-7).</p>

<p>The <strong>Edit Reports</strong> step shows detailed information on the layout of
your reports. The <strong>Report</strong> column indicates the report, or
cross-tabulation report, number based on the variable(s) chosen during
the criteria selection. Under the <strong>All</strong> tab, reports may be chosen for
the report-building phase, either by selecting <strong>All</strong> or selecting
individual reports. The <strong>Action</strong> column gives you the option to
<strong>Preview</strong>, <strong>Edit</strong>, <strong>Delete</strong>, or <strong>Copy</strong> the report. The
<strong>Dependent Variable</strong> column shows which dependent variable the report will portray. The
<strong>Grouping Variable</strong> column indicates the variable(s) included in the report.
The <strong>Year</strong> column shows which years you have selected for comparison.
The <strong>Jurisdiction</strong> column shows the countries and subnational
education systems selected for comparison, and the <strong>Statistic</strong> column
provides the type of statistic output that will be generated in the
report-building phase.</p>

Cross-Tabulated Report 1, Cross-Tabulated Report 2, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Select a dependent variable. You can choose a dependent variable if more than one was slected at step 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Select which jurisdictions, grouping variables, years (if applicable), and
statistics to include (out of the selections previously made at
steps 1 and 2). You can select up to two statistics options from the
following: averages, percentages, standard deviations, and
percentiles. (For further information, see Section Statistics
Options.)</p></li>
<li><p>To create a new variable while editing a report, click on <strong>Create
New…</strong> under the <strong>Grouping Variable</strong> heading.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the table layout by dragging elements to determine which

and “Almost always” are checked</p></li>
<li><p>Create a name for the new value, and press <strong>Create</strong>. The collapsed values will appear in gray to indicate that they have already been used.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 3 and 4 to collapse other values if applicable. In the
example below (see exhibit 4-10b), “Sometimes” and “Never” will be
collapsed into “Sometimes or Never”. Note that it is also possible
to leave “Sometimes” and “Never” uncollapsed, thus skipping step 5.</p></li>
<li><p>Press <strong>Done</strong> when the screen has refreshed.</p></li>
<li><p>The new variable will appear in the <strong>Grouping Variable</strong> list in the <strong>Edit

<p>A new variable that you create is applicable only to a specific report;
it does not apply to the other reports listed on the <strong>Edit Reports</strong>
screen. For example, if you selected multiple dependent variables of science
literacy for analysis, then you would need to create the new variable
for each dependent variable, or create a copy of the report and edit it
accordingly. To do the latter, click on <strong>Copy</strong> report on the <strong>Edit
Reports</strong> screen (copied reports appear at the end of the list of
reports) and then, for the new copy, click on <strong>Edit</strong> (using the above
example, you can change the dependent variable and give the report a new name).</p>
<p>You can repeat the process and combine different values of a variable to
create additional new variables. Using the <strong>Create New Report</strong>
function, you can create a new report for each new variable that you
create. (For further information, see section Create New Report.)</p>
<p>If you selected two or three variables from which to create new
variables, you can repeat the process for each of them. Using the
<strong>Create New Report</strong> or <strong>Edit Report</strong> function, these collapsed
variables will be listed and available for cross-tabulation (see exhibit
4-11). If you have chosen four or more variables (not counting <strong>All Cases</strong>), you won’t get the cross-tabulation. You can click <strong>Preview</strong> to see how the table will be laid out before retrieving data.</p>

<p>From the main <strong>Edit Reports</strong> screen, clicking on <strong>Format Options</strong>
will allow you to make formatting changes applicable to all the reports
listed. The following formatting options are available using this
function (see exhibit 4-13):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Variable Labels</strong> gives you the option to display a more detailed
description of the variables selected in a query (<strong>Long</strong>) than the
default label (<strong>Short</strong>). For variables from questionnaires, the
full text of the question is displayed when <strong>Long</strong> is selected. Be
advised that the length of the extra detail may sometimes interfere
with table formatting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Show data for values categorized as Missing</strong> will include the
percentage of students in the total sample or in a reporting group
for whom membership in a particular response category is unknown
because no response was given by the students, their teacher, or
their school. The percentage of “missing” will be shown in the
right-most table column. Missing data are available only for queries
that involve percentages as the statistic type. Unless you check
this option, the default is for missing responses not to be included
in the percentage distribution shown.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decimal Places</strong> allows you to specify the level of precision for
a particular statistic. Depending on the value range of the
dependent variable (for example, the dependent variable “TIMSS
Mathematics Scale: Overall Mathematics” ranges from 0 to 1000; the
dependent variable “Students like learning mathematics scale
[AS5BG071]” ranges from 4 to 13), the default decimal places for a
report could be from zero to three. Also, standard errors will be
shown to one more decimal place than is shown for a particular
statistic. For example, if you request that average scores be
displayed to one decimal place (by default, the average scores are
displayed as whole numbers), the corresponding standard errors will
be displayed to two decimal places. If you export to Excel, you will
be able to increase the number of decimal places in most cases. Note
that only integer-level precision is allowed for percentages; that
is, the number of decimal places is fixed at “none” for percentages
and the corresponding standard errors are shown to one decimal
place.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include</strong> gives you the option of showing standard errors. By
default, standard errors are shown inside parentheses, but you have
the option of choosing to show them without parentheses. You can
preview the effects of your selection in the <strong>Sample Display</strong> area
(see the blue-shaded box at the bottom of exhibit 4-13).</p></li>

<strong>Statistics Options</strong> allows you to designate up to two statistics. The
selections you make are applicable to all the reports listed, although
you can also change the statistics for an individual report when you
edit it. (For further information, see Section Edit Report.)</p>
<p>The following statistics options are available (see exhibit 4-14):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Averages.</strong> This statistic provides the average value for a
selected continuous variable or score (i.e., overall score or
subscale score). For the TIMSS assessment, student performance is
reported on scales that range from 0 to 1,000. By default, the
standard errors of the scores are shown in parentheses.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Percentages.</strong> This statistic shows the percentage of students as
a row percentage. For example, if the first column lists countries,
then each country will display its own percentage distribution
across its row. By default, percentage distributions do not include
missing data. For information on how to show data for values
categorized as missing, see Section Format Options.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Standard deviations.</strong> The standard deviation is a measure of how
widely or narrowly dispersed scores are for a particular variable.
Under general normality assumptions, 95 percent of the scores are
within two standard deviations of the mean. For example, if the
average score of a variable is 500 and the standard deviation is
100, it means that 95 percent of the scores in this variable fall
between 300 and 700. The standard deviation is the square root of
the variance.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Percentiles.</strong> This statistic shows the threshold (or cutpoint)
score for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>10<sup>th</sup> percentile—the bottom 10 percent of students</p></li>
<li><p>25<sup>th</sup> percentile—the bottom quarter of students</p></li>
<li><p>50<sup>th</sup> percentile—the median (half the students scored below
the cutpoint and half scored above it)</p></li>
<li><p>75<sup>th</sup> percentile—the top quarter of students</p></li>

<p>As previously noted, the selections you make in <strong>Statistics Options</strong>
will be applied automatically to all reports, although you can change
the statistics for an individual report when you edit it. Be advised
that if you use <strong>Statistics Options</strong> after editing the statistics in
one or more of your individual reports, the statistics options selected
will overwrite your previously edited selections. If you wish to use the
same criteria and variables in a report with a different selection of
statistics, consider using the <strong>Create New Report</strong> function to
generate a new report with different statistics. (For further
information, see Section Create New Report.) You can also make a
copy of an individual report.</p>
<p>You can use the <strong>Reset</strong> button, located in the upper-right portion of
the main <strong>Edit Reports</strong> screen (just below the <strong>Help</strong> button), to
restore the <strong>Statistics Options</strong> to the default setting, which is
averages for all reports (this will also delete any new reports that you
created).</p>
<p>Not all statistics are available for all reports. Their availability
depends on other selections you have made to define the content and
format of your report:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Percentages will not display if jurisdictions or years appear in
columns.</p></li>
<li><p>If benchmarks are selected in the variable section, only average
scores and percentages will be displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that results obtained from the IDE might not always match
those published by the International Association for the Evaluation of
Educational Achievement (IEA). This is due to the use of different
reporting standards, such as suppression rules related to sample size,
and suppression due to response rates. In addition, results published by
the IEA using teacher data make use of all available teacher data for
any one student, whereas results obtained from the IDE make use of only
one teacher per student. In other words, in IEA published data, when a
student has more than one teacher, the individual student weight is
distributed evenly across all responding teachers of that student. In
the IDE, under the same circumstances, the response of a single teacher
is selected at random and assigned to the student. While the results are
expected to be the same, there is some small variation due to the random
selection of the teacher response. This affects results for teacher
data, calculated for 4th and 8th graders, and is only noticeable in
cases where students have multiple teachers.</p>

<p>Tests for statistical significance indicate whether observed differences
between estimates are likely to have occurred because of sampling error
or chance. “Significance” here does not imply any judgment about
absolute magnitude or educational relevance. It refers only to the
statistical nature of the difference and whether that difference likely
reflects a true difference in the population.</p>
<p>With your report of interest selected, click the <strong>Significance Test</strong>
link, which is located to the right of the <strong>Chart</strong> link (see exhibit
4-16 and 4-21). You first need to decide which variable you want to test and
the criterion by which you want to test it (i.e., between jurisdictions,
within variables, or across years). You will compare or look across the
variable’s range of values, so it must have more than one value. You can
look across jurisdictions for a variable (that is, compare between two
or more jurisdictions) or you can look across the values within a
variable for a single jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The general steps for running significance tests are as follows (see
exhibit 4-22):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the <strong>Significance Test</strong> window, select either <strong>Between
Jurisdictions</strong>, <strong>Within Grouping Variables</strong>, or <strong>Across Years</strong>. Then,
select the appropriate jurisdiction(s), variable(s), year(s), and
statistic(s). For <strong>Between Jurisdictions</strong>, select at least two
jurisdictions. For <strong>Within Grouping Variables</strong>, select at least two
variable values. For <strong>Across Years</strong>, more than one year needs to
be selected.</p></li>
<li><p>You can enter a <strong>Name</strong> limited to 25 characters, using only
letters, numbers, spaces, underscores, and hyphens (otherwise, by
default, the test is named “Sig Test 1”).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the output type as either <strong>Table</strong> or <strong>Map</strong>. The table
option will show the significance test results as a matrix. The map
option will show the significance test results on a world map,
highlighting countries and subnational education systems that have
been selected. The map output is only available when <strong>Between
Jurisdictions</strong> is selected in the first step.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional options allow you to select <strong>Show table details</strong> to
display the estimates and standard errors for the table cells. If
you selected a map, this option is not applicable, as the map will
automatically show score details.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Preview</strong> tab located in the upper-left corner, or the
<strong>Preview</strong> button located in the bottom-left corner.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> tab in the upper-left corner of the screen if you
wish to go back and make changes to the selections you made for

<p>When the table option is selected, you will get a significance test
matrix in which you will see the differences and <em>p</em> values. Using the
symbols shown in the legend of the matrix, an indication is also
provided of whether one estimate is significantly lower or higher than
another estimate or whether there is no significant difference (see
exhibit 4-23).</p>
<p>The alpha level for all <em>t</em>-tests is .05. All comparisons within a jurisdiction, within the same year, are made using dependent <em>t</em>-tests. Comparisons between jurisdictions are treated as independent. Non-achievement comparisons across years are treated as independent. Comparisons of achievement across years are made using independent <em>t</em>-tests with a linking error taken into account. A part-whole adjustment is implemented for comparisons between a jurisdiction and a group that the jurisdiction is part of (e.g. Average of Countries).</p>

or gap, can be viewed between groups, between years, between groups and
years, or between percentiles within the selected variable. For example,
if you compute average mathematics scores for two countries at two time
points for males and females, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>at one time point, compare the male-female gap in one country to the
male-female gap in another country;</p></li>
<li><p>compare the male-female gap at two time points within a country;</p></li>
<li><p>compare the difference between the male-female gap at two time
points in one country to the difference between the male-female gap
at two time points in another country; or</p></li>
<li><p>compare the gap for females at two time points in one country to the
gap for females at two time points in another country.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>The steps for running a gap analysis are similar to those for conducting
a statistical significance test (see exhibit 4-26). Thus, to run a gap
analysis, follow the instructions under section <strong>Significance
Tests</strong>, noting the following differences:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <strong>Gap Analysis</strong> link should be selected, not the <strong>Significance
Test</strong> link.</p></li>
<li><p>The gap analysis does not have a <strong>Within Grouping Variables</strong> option for
analysis; the options are <strong>Between Jurisdictions</strong> and <strong>Across
Years.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The difference measure (gap) of analysis must be selected from the
following: <strong>Between Groups, Between Years, Between Groups and
Years,</strong> and <strong>Between Percentiles</strong> (if variables are selected for
which a difference measure is not feasible, the difference measure
option will not appear as available in the Gap Analysis menu).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The gap analysis output is presented in a format similar to that of the
significance test output, with one difference: the difference estimate
shown in the output is the difference between the gaps selected for
analysis. Note that you will still see the significance of these
differences just like in a significance test. For example, exhibit 4-27
shows cross-national differences between male-female score gaps among
8<sup>th</sup> grade students.</p>
<p>The gap analysis function computes and statistically tests differences
between score, percentage, or percentile gaps. All gap comparisons are
made using independent samples <em>t</em>-tests with an alpha level of 0.05.
Note that the reference group for the gaps is kept constant during the
analysis, as opposed to taking the absolute value of the gaps.
Therefore, the gap analysis tests whether the magnitude of the gaps
differ from each other only when the gaps go in the same direction
(e.g., comparing a 5-point gender gap favoring females in one country
with a 15-point gender gap favoring females in another country).</p>

</div>
<p>Note that a gap analysis across years cannot be combined with the
Between Years or Between Groups and Years difference measures, so you
will select the difference measure Between Groups, or, if you have
selected percentiles as one of your statistics, you may choose Between
Percentiles.</p>

<p>Regression Analysis is included in the IDE to test for the relationship
between one or more independent variables with a dependent variable,
with the independent variables controlling for each other. The type of
analysis performed in this feature of the IDE is referred to as linear
regression, with the dependent variable being a continuous variable
selected at step 1.</p>
<div class="inline-figure">Exhibit 4-28. Regression analysis link selection
<img src="images/chapter4/image29.png" style="width:6.5in;height:1.90417in" alt="Exhibit 4-28 is a screenshot from the TIMSS IDE tool showing how to select the regression analysis function in the Build Reports tab.">
</div>
<p>A regression analysis can be performed based on the selections that were
made to build your table in the IDE by selecting the <strong>Regression
Analysis</strong> button above the table (see Exhibit 4-28). The <strong>Dependent Variable</strong>, or
continuous variable, that you selected in Step 1 and that is displayed
in your table will automatically become your dependent variable for the
regression analysis (in Exhibit 4-28 this is “TIMSS Mathematics Scale:
Overall Mathematics”). Please note that continuous variables cannot be
used as independent variables. The variables that you selected in Step 2
and that are displayed in your table will become your independent
variable options for the regression analysis (in Exhibit 4-28 this is “Sex
of student”).</p>
<p>The general steps for running a regression analysis are as follows (see
exhibit 4-29):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the <strong>Regression Analysis</strong> pop-up window, you can enter a
<strong>Name</strong> limited to 25 characters, using only letters, numbers,
spaces, underscores, and hyphens (otherwise, by default, the test
will be named “Regression 1”).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the appropriate jurisdiction, year, and variable(s) for
analysis. Please note that you may only choose one jurisdiction and
year at a time, but you may choose up to 3 independent variables to
be in your report. In order to use up to 3 variables, you must have
already created and selected a cross-tabulated report (by selecting
3 variables in Step 2, <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Preview</strong> tab located in the upper-left corner to view
the table format into which your output will be populated. In the
Preview tab, an “X” denotes where the output will display.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> tab in the upper-left corner of the screen if you
wish to go back and make changes to the selections you made for
running the analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Done</strong> button in the upper- or lower-right corner of the
screen to run the regression analysis.</p></li>
</ol>

</div>
<p>After you have clicked <strong>Done</strong>, your regression analysis output will
load onto the screen (see exhibit 4-30). A 0-1 contrast coding is used to
code the independent variable, where the first subgroup of the
independent variable is the reference group. Using dummy-coded variables
in a linear regression is useful for comparing each subgroup against a
reference group. For example, in exhibit 4-30, if the subgroup “Female” is
the reference group for the independent variable <strong>Sex of student
[ITSEX]</strong>, the IDE creates a “Male” dummy variable (1 for respondents
who answered “Male”, 0 otherwise). Reference group “Female” is excluded
from the regression analysis.</p>

</div>
<p>Using the output from exhibit 4-30 you can compare the average mathematics
achievement of 8<sup>th</sup> grade students who are female to the average
mathematics achievement of 8<sup>th</sup> grade students who are female. When a
single dummy-coded variable is used in a regression, the <em>intercept</em> is
the mean of the reference group (e.g., 529.0473), and the <em>regression
coefficient</em> is the difference between the mean of the reference group
and the group identified (coded 1) with the dummy-coded variable (e.g.,
11.1312 for students who are Male). Since the regression coefficients
are presented with a standard error and a <em>t</em> value, these can be used
to test whether a difference between means is statistically significant.
Under the Significance column in the output you will see 3 possible
signs: 1) &lt; signifies a significant negative difference, 2) &gt;
signifies a significant positive difference, and 3) x signifies the
difference is not statistically significant.</p>

<p>Click on the <strong>Export Reports</strong> button located on the right side of the
<strong>Build Reports</strong> screen to save or print your tables, charts, and

<p>Check the files you want to export, and select one of the file formats:
<strong>HTML</strong> (print-friendly), <strong>Excel, Word,</strong> or <strong>PDF</strong> (see exhibit 4-31).
All reports that you select at the same time will be exported in one
file. In the Excel format, you will be able to increase the
decimal places wherever more precision is available. Because
there are many different operating systems in use, you may get an error
message with Excel or one of the other formats. Usually, this will not
affect your ability to export, so please wait for the software “errors”
to resolve.</p>
<p>Charts or maps for each report will only be available on the <strong>Export
Reports</strong> menu if you saved them by clicking <strong>Done</strong> when you finished
each one. If a chart or map that you wish to save or print is grayed out
(not available for selection), cancel the <strong>Export Reports</strong> tool, go
back to your chart or map, and be sure to click <strong>Done</strong> on the last
screen. After that, it will be available for export.</p>
