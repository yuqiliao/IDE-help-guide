<p>Your data query in the IDE (International Data Explorer) begins on the
<strong>Select Criteria</strong> screen (see exhibit 3-2).</p>
<p>Choose one <strong>Subject</strong>, and one or more <strong>Dependent Variables, Years,</strong> and
<strong>Jurisdictions</strong> for the data you wish to view or compare.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>Reset</strong> button located in the upper right portion of the
screen (just below the <strong>Help</strong> button) to erase your choices and begin
again.</p>
<p>Click on a blue sideways facing arrow (►) to open up a category and
click on a blue downward facing arrow (▼) to close a category.</p>

<p>Under <strong>Dependent Variable,</strong> you can choose the combined reading scale and/or any
of the reading subscales. Note that the combined reading scale is the
default (as shown in exhibit 3-2). The 2001 and 2006 reading subscales
have been rescaled to allow for comparisons to 2011 and later years.</p>
<p>In addition, there are a number of variables other than scale scores
that you may choose as a dependent variable (see exhibit 3-3). These variables—such
as age, teaching experience, and class size—are all continuous
variables and are used as a dependent variable of analysis.</p>
<p>You may also choose the survey year (All years, 2016, 2011, 2006, or
2001) at the top of either step 1 or 2. Notice for which years a
dependent variable, jurisdiction, or variable data are available by looking below
each year for the grid of dots (which means data are available) or the
“No data” slash.</p>

<p>With your dependent variable selected, next choose at least one <strong>Jurisdiction.</strong></p>
<p>Jurisdictions are found under the following groups: <strong>Country</strong> and
<strong>Benchmarking jurisdictions,</strong> and <strong>Off-Grade Level Participants.</strong>
There is also a group category called <strong>Average,</strong> with options to
display the <strong>Average of Countries</strong> and the <strong>Average of Selected
Countries/Participants.</strong> Please note that selecting <strong>Average of
Countries</strong> or <strong>Average of Selected Countries/Participants</strong> may
produce an error message in the <strong>Build Reports</strong> step due to the high
volume of information contained in these groups.</p>
<p>The general procedures for selecting one or more jurisdictions are as
follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To open or close jurisdictions, click on the arrow. Jurisdictions in
the group are open and can be selected when the blue arrow points
down (see exhibit 3-4).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the checkboxes next to specific jurisdictions that you are
interested in, or uncheck those jurisdictions that you wish to
deselect. If you click the checkbox next to the group name (e.g.,
“Country”), you will select all the jurisdictions within that group.
If desired, uncheck the group name to deselect all.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to close a group (for example, close the list of
countries in order to readily see the benchmarking jurisdictions),
click the blue arrow next to the group name. The closed group’s
arrow points to the right. Be advised that closing the group will
not deselect your choices.</p></li>

</h3>
<p>Choose at least one variable on this screen for your report. One way to
do this is to search for variables using the <strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Sub
Category</strong> lists. If you don’t wish to choose from any of the specified
categories and subcategories, then select <strong>All cases.</strong></p>
<p>The variables shown are tied to the criteria you selected at step 1
(<strong>Dependent Variable, Year</strong> and <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>), which are indicated at the top
of the screen. To change any of these criteria, return to step 1,
<strong>Select Criteria</strong>.</p>
<p>To browse for variables, get details about them, select them, and view
them:</p>

<p>The second way to search for variables is to use the <strong>Search</strong> function
on the <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong> screen.</p>
<p>Type a term in the <strong>Search</strong> box and click <strong>Go</strong> (or hit “Enter” on
your keyboard) to find variables by keywords in the question and/or
details for the variable (see exhibit 3-7). If you use multiple keywords,
“and” is assumed. You can also narrow your search by using “or,” “not,”
or “and not.” The search function operates on an exact phrase if it is
contained in quotes. The variable(s) that include the search term(s) in
the question or its details will be listed.</p>
<p>See Section 2.B. Search Using Category and Subcategory Lists (page 11)
for information on how to get details about variables, selecting
variables, and viewing variables.</p>

<p>You can access step 3, <strong>Edit Reports,</strong> after choosing criteria at step
1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>, and choosing at least one variable at step 2,
<strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong>. The IDE will automatically build reports based on
your selections from steps 1 and 2. However, at step 3, the <strong>Edit
Reports</strong> phase, you may modify your selections for each report.</p>
<p>At this step, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Preview and edit the layout of your reports;</p></li>
<li><p>Copy reports or create new reports based on the variables selected;</p></li>
<li><p>Change formatting options, such as the number of decimal places to
display, for all reports (these may also be changed in individual
reports, but formatting options can overwrite previous edits);</p></li>
<li><p>Change statistics options, such as averages and achievement levels,
for all reports (these may also be changed in individual reports,
but statistics options can overwrite previous edits);</p></li>
<li><p>Select reports to be built into tables and charts at step 4, <strong>Build
Reports</strong>; and</p></li>
<li><p>Delete reports.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using your chosen criteria, the IDE will return a separate data report
for each variable you have chosen. If you have selected two or three
variables (not counting <strong>All cases</strong>), you will also see a
cross-tabulated report that crosses these variables. If your selected
criteria include more than one dependent variable (e.g., combined reading scale and
age), a separate set of data reports will be generated for each dependent variable
(see exhibit 3-8, page 14).</p>
<div class="inline-figure">Exhibit 3-8. Edit reports overview

</div>
<p>The <strong>Edit Reports</strong> step shows detailed information on the layout of
your reports (see exhibit 3-8). The <strong>Report</strong> column indicates the
report, or cross-tabulation report, number based on the variable(s)
chosen during the criteria selection. The <strong>Action</strong> column gives you
the option to <strong>Preview</strong>, <strong>Edit, Delete</strong>, or <strong>Copy</strong> the report.
Here, reports may be chosen for the report-building phase under the
<strong>All</strong> tab, either by selecting <strong>All</strong> or selecting individual
reports. The <strong>Grouping Variable</strong> column indicates the variable(s) included in
the report. The <strong>Year</strong> column shows which years you have selected for
comparison. The <strong>Jurisdiction</strong> column labels the countries and
subnational education systems for comparison, and the <strong>Statistic</strong>
column provides the type of statistic output that will be generated in
the report-building phase.</p>

will be laid out (see exhibit 3-8). The preview will not provide actual
data, but will show how the data will be arranged in rows and columns
(see exhibit 3-9, page 15). You can select <strong>Preview</strong> at any time to see
how your changes will affect the report’s final layout.</p>

<p>A new variable that you create is applicable to that specific report; it
does not apply to the other reports appearing in the <strong>Edit Reports</strong>
screen. For example, if you selected multiple dependent variables of reading
literacy for analysis, then you would need to create the new variable
for each dependent variable or create a copy of the report and edit it accordingly.
To do the latter, click on <strong>Copy</strong> report in the <strong>Edit Reports</strong>
screen (copied reports appear at the end of the list of reports) and
then <strong>Edit</strong> the new copy (using the above example, you can change the
dependent variable and give the report a new name).</p>
<p>You can repeat the process and combine different values of a variable to
create additional new variables. Using the <strong>Create New Report</strong>
function, you can create a new report for each new variable that you
create. (For further information, see Section 3.E. Create New Report,
page 19.)</p>
<p>If you selected two or three variables from which to create new
variables, you can repeat the process for each of them. Using the
<strong>Create New Report</strong> or <strong>Edit Report</strong> function, these collapsed
variables will be listed and available for cross-tabulation (see exhibit
3-12). You can click <strong>Preview</strong> to see how the table will be laid out
before retrieving data.</p>

integer-level precision is allowed for percentages; that is, the
number of decimal places is fixed at “none” for percentages. Also,
standard errors will be shown to one more decimal place than is
shown for a particular statistic. For example, if you request that
the averages be displayed to one decimal place, the corresponding

selections made are applicable to <em>all</em> the reports listed, although you
can also change the statistics for an individual report when you edit
that report. (For further information, see Section 3.C. Edit Report,
page 15.)</p>
<p>The following statistics options are available (see exhibit 3-15):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Averages.</strong> This statistic provides the average value for a
selected continuous variable or the average scale score for the
combined reading scale or one of the reading subscales. For the
PIRLS assessment, student performance is reported on scales that
range from 0 to 1,000. PIRLS reports the average scale score for a
variety of demographic samples of the student population (e.g., the
average scale score in reading for literary purposes for female
students).</li>
</ol>
<!-- --><ol start="17" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Percentages.</strong> This statistic shows the percentage of students as
a row percentage. For example, if the first column lists countries,
then each country will display its own percentage distribution
across its row. If the table cell for Black female students in the
United States is 9 percent, then Black females constituted 9 percent
of U.S. fourth-graders. By default, percentage distributions do not
include missing data. For information on how to show data for values
categorized as missing, see Section 3.F. Format Options, above.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Achievement levels—discrete.</strong> Discrete achievement levels are
reported as the percentage of students performing <em>at</em> each
international benchmark (<em>low, intermediate, high,</em> or <em>advanced)</em>,
counted separately from the other benchmarks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Below low</em>—below 400</p></li>
<li><p><em>At</em> <em>low</em>—between 400 and 475</p></li>
<li><p><em>At</em> <em>intermediate</em>—between 475 and 550</p></li>
<li><p><em>At</em> <em>high</em>—between 550 and 625</p></li>
<li><p><em>At</em> <em>advanced</em>—above 625</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Achievement levels—cumulative.</strong> Cumulative achievement levels
are reported as the percentage of students performing <em>at or above</em>
each international benchmark:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>At or above</em> <em>low</em>—at or above 400</p></li>
<li><p><em>At or above</em> <em>intermediate</em>—at or above 475</p></li>
<li><p><em>At or above</em> <em>high</em>—at or above 550</p></li>
<li><p><em>At advanced</em>—above 625</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Percentiles.</strong> This statistic shows the threshold (or cutpoint)
score for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>10<sup>th</sup> percentile—the bottom 10 percent of students</p></li>
<li><p>25<sup>th</sup> percentile—the bottom quarter of students</p></li>
<li><p>50<sup>th</sup> percentile—the bottom half of students (half the
students scored at or below the cutpoint and half scored above
it)</p></li>
<li><p>75<sup>th</sup> percentile—the top quarter of students</p></li>
<li><p>90<sup>th</sup> percentile—the top 10 percent of students</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Standard deviations.</strong> The standard deviation is a dependent variable of how
widely or narrowly dispersed scores are for a particular dataset.
Under general normality assumptions,<br>
95 percent of the scores are within two standard deviations of the
mean. For example,<br>
if the average score of a dataset is 500 and the standard deviation
is 100, it means that<br>
95 percent of the scores in this dataset fall between 300 and 700.
The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.</p></li>

an individual report when you edit it. Be advised that if you use
<strong>Statistics Options</strong> after editing the statistics in one or more of
your individual reports, the statistics options selected will overwrite
your previously edited selections. If you wish to use the same criteria
and variables in a report with a different selection of statistics,
consider using the <strong>Create New Report</strong> function to generate a new
report with different statistics. (For further information, see Section
3.E. Create New Report, page 19.) You can also make a copy of an

<p>Not all statistics are available for all reports. Their availability
depends on other selections you have made to define the content and
format of your report:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Percentages will not display if jurisdictions or years appear in
columns.</p></li>
<li><p>Achievement-level results cannot be displayed in both columns and
rows.</p></li>
<li><p>Achievement-level results are available only for the composite or
overall scale.</p></li>
<li><p>If achievement levels are selected as a variable, only percentages
will be displayed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the statistics produced by the IDE may not match the
statistics shown in reports published by the International Association
for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) due to differences
in certain statistical standards. In particular, organizations such as
NCES and the IEA differ in the minimum sample sizes required for
publishing student scores. Furthermore, in IEA reports, if a student has
more than one teacher, estimates for teacher variables are calculated as
an average of data reported by all of the teachers. In comparison, in
the IDE, a student is randomly assigned one teacher, and the teacher
estimate represents the data reported by the teacher assigned to the
student.</p>

<p>Tests for statistical significance indicate whether observed differences
between assessment results are likely to have occurred because of
sampling error or chance. “Significance” here does not imply any
judgment about absolute magnitude or educational relevance. It refers
only to the statistical nature of the difference and whether that
difference likely reflects a true difference in the population.</p>
<p>With your report of interest selected, click the <strong>Significance Test</strong>
link, which is located to the right of the <strong>Chart</strong> link (see exhibit
3-24, above). You first need to decide which variable you want to test and
the criterion by which you want to test it (i.e., within or between
variable values or across years). You will compare or “look across” the
variable’s range of values, so it must have more than one value. You can
look across jurisdictions for a variable (that is, compare between two
or more jurisdictions) or you can look across the values within a
variable for a single jurisdiction. For example, with the variables
shown in exhibit 3-25, you could choose to compare female scores between
countries, or you could choose to compare male and female scores within
a country. Once the primary criterion is chosen, all other criteria must
be restricted to a single value.</p>
<p>The general steps for running significance tests are as follows (see
exhibit 3-25):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the <strong>Significance Test</strong> window, select either <strong>Between

</div>
<p>When the table option is selected, you will get a significance test
matrix in which you will see the differences and <em>p</em> values. Using the
symbols shown in the legend of the matrix, an indication is also
provided of whether one estimate is significantly lower or higher than
another estimate or whether there is no significant difference (see
exhibit 3-26).</p>
<p>The alpha level for all <em>t</em>-tests is .05. All comparisons within a jurisdiction, within the same year, are made using dependent <em>t</em>-tests. Comparisons between jurisdictions are treated as independent. Non-achievement comparisons across years are treated as independent. Comparisons of achievement across years are made using independent <em>t</em>-tests with a linking error taken into account. A part-whole adjustment is implemented for comparisons between a jurisdiction and a group that the jurisdiction is part of (e.g. Average of Countries).</p>

</div>
<p>When the map option is selected, a global map is shown with the
countries selected shaded (see exhibit 3-27). The focal jurisdiction is
shaded in blue and represents a comparison for all the other countries.
The other countries are shaded in colors that indicate whether they are
higher, lower, or not significantly different from the focal
jurisdiction on whatever dependent variable has been selected. When you scroll over
a country, a text bubble pops up describing the strength of the
difference between that country and the focal jurisdiction. At any point
you may choose a different focal jurisdiction by clicking on another
country.</p>

</h3>
<p>Gap Analysis is included in the IDE to compare differences in gaps shown
in a map, table, or chart. These gap differences can be compared between
jurisdictions and/or across years.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 3-28. Gap analysis link selection</strong>
<img src="images/chapter3/image28.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.28979in" alt="Exhibit 3-28 is a screenshot from the PIRLS IDE tool showing how to select the gap analysis function in the Build Reports tab."></p>
<p>With your report of interest selected, click on the <strong>Gap Analysis</strong>
link, which is located to the right of the <strong>Significance Test</strong> link
(see exhibit 3-28). You will need to decide which variable you would like
to test (e.g., sex of students) and the criterion by which you want to
test it (i.e., between jurisdictions or across years). The difference
dependent variable, or gap, can be viewed between groups, between years, between
groups and years, or between percentiles within the selected variable.
For example, if you compute average reading scores for two countries at
two time points for males and females, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>at one time point, compare the male-female gap in one country to the
male-female gap in another country;</p></li>
<li><p>compare the male-female gap at two time points within a country;</p></li>
<li><p>compare the difference between the male-female gap at two time
points in one country to the difference between the male-female gap
at two time points in another country; or</p></li>
<li><p>compare the gap for females at two time points in one country to the
gap for females at two time points in another country.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exhibit 3-29. Gap analysis options</strong>
<img src="images/chapter3/image29.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.28979in" alt="Exhibit 3-29 is a screenshot from the PIRLS IDE tool showing the gap analysis options available in the Build Reports tab."></p>
<p>The steps for running a gap analysis are similar to those for conducting
a statistical significance test (see exhibit 3-29). Thus, to run a gap
analysis, follow the instructions under section <strong>4.F. Significance
Tests</strong>, noting the following differences:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The <strong>Gap Analysis</strong> link should be selected, not the <strong>Significance
Test</strong> link.</p></li>
<li><p>The gap analysis does not have a <strong>Within Variables</strong> option for
analysis; the options are <strong>Between Jurisdictions</strong> and <strong>Across
Years.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The difference dependent variable (gap) of analysis must be selected from the
following: <strong>Between Groups, Between Years, Between Groups and
Years,</strong> and <strong>Between Percentiles</strong> (if variables are selected for
which a difference dependent variable is not feasible, the difference dependent variable
option will not appear as available in the Gap Analysis menu).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The gap analysis output is presented in a format similar to that of the
significance test output, with one difference: the difference estimate
shown in the output is the difference between the gaps selected for
analysis. Note that you will still see the significance of these
differences just like in a significance test. For example, exhibit 3-30
shows the difference between jurisdictions in the average reading score
gap between male and female 4<sup>th</sup> grade students in 2016.</p>
<p>The gap analysis function computes and statistically tests differences
between average value/score, percentage, or percentile gaps. Note that
the reference group for the gaps is kept constant during the analysis,
as opposed to taking the absolute value of the gaps. Therefore, the gap
analysis tests whether the magnitude of the gaps differ from each other
only when the gaps go in the same direction (e.g., comparing a 5-point
gender gap favoring females in one country with a 15-point gender gap
favoring females in another country).</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 3-30. Gap analysis output</strong>
<img src="images/chapter3/image30.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.28979in" alt="Exhibit 3-30 is a screenshot from the PIRLS IDE tool showing an example output report based on the gap analysis options."></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A gap analysis across years cannot be combined with the
Between Years or Between Groups and Years difference measures, so you
will select the difference dependent variable Between Groups, or, if you have
selected percentiles as one of your statistics, you may choose Between
Percentiles.</p>

</h3>
<p>Regression Analysis is included in the IDE to test for trends across
more than two data points. The type of analysis performed in this
feature of the IDE is referred to as linear regression within the field
of statistics. To run a regression, first go to <strong>Build Reports</strong> and
choose the report of interest from the drop-down <strong>Select Report</strong> menu.
Then click on the <strong>Regression Analysis</strong> link, which is to the right of
the <strong>Gap Analysis</strong> link (see exhibit 3-31).</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 3-31. Regression analysis link selection</strong>
<img src="images/chapter3/image31.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.28979in" alt="Exhibit 3-31 is a screenshot from the PIRLS IDE tool showing how to select the regression analysis function in the Build Reports tab."></p>
<p>The general steps for running a regression analysis are as follows (see
exhibit 3-32):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the <strong>Regression Analysis</strong> pop-up window, enter a <strong>Name</strong>
limited to 25 characters, using only letters, numbers, spaces,
underscores, and hyphens (otherwise, by default, the test will be
named “Regression 1”).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the appropriate jurisdiction, year, and variable(s) for
analysis. Please note that you may only choose one jurisdiction and
year at a time, but you may choose up to 3 variables to be in your
report. In order to use up to 3 variables, you must have already
created and selected a cross-tabulated report (by selecting 3
variables in Step 2, <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Preview</strong> tab located in the upper-left corner to view
the table format into which your output will be populated. In the
Preview tab, an “X” denotes where the output will display.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> tab in the upper-left corner of the screen if you
wish to go back and make changes to the selections you made for
running the analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Done</strong> button in the upper- or lower-right corner of the
screen to run the regression analysis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exhibit 3-32: Regression analysis options</strong>
<img src="images/chapter3/image32.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.28979in" alt="Exhibit 3-32 is a screenshot from the PIRLS IDE tool showing the options for the regression analysis output."></p>
<p>After you have clicked <strong>Done</strong>, your regression analysis output will
load onto the screen (see exhibit 3-33). A 0-1 contrast coding is used to
code the independent variable, where the first subgroup of the
independent variable is the reference group. Using dummy-coded variables
in a linear regression is useful for comparing each subgroup against a
reference group. For example, in exhibit 3-33, if the subgroup "Like
reading" is the reference group for the independent variable <strong>Index of
Students like Reading (2016) <span class="math display">\[ASDGSLR\]</span></strong>, the IDE creates a “Somewhat
like reading” dummy variable (1 for respondents who answered “Somewhat
like reading”, 0 otherwise), a “Do not like reading” dummy variable (1
for respondents who answered “Do not like reading”, 0 otherwise).
Reference group “Like reading” is excluded from the regression analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 3-33. Regression analysis output</strong>
<img src="images/chapter3/image33.png" style="width:6.5in;height:5.28979in" alt="Exhibit 3-33 is a screenshot from the PIRLS IDE tool showing an example of the regression analysis output."></p>
<p>Using the output from exhibit 3-33 you can compare the mean reading score
of 4<sup>th</sup> grade students who somewhat like reading or do not like reading
to the mean reading score of those who like reading. When a single
dummy-coded variable is used in a regression, the <em>intercept</em> is the
mean of the reference group (e.g., 557.3185), and the <em>regression
coefficient</em> is the difference between the mean of the reference group
and the group identified (coded 1) with the dummy-coded variable (e.g.,
-4.4723 for Somewhat like reading). Since the regression coefficients
are presented with a standard error and a <em>t</em> value, these can be used
to test whether a difference between means is statistically significant.
Under the Significance column in the output you will see 3 possible
signs: 1) &lt; signifies a significant negative difference, 2) &gt;
signifies a significant positive difference, and 3) x signifies the
difference is not statistically significant.</p>

of the screen to save or print your tables, charts, and significance
tests. The report names that appear in the <strong>Export Reports</strong> window are
those that were checked off at step 3, <strong>Edit Reports</strong>.</p>
<p>Check the files you want to export, and select one of the file formats:
<strong>HTML</strong> (print-friendly), <strong>Excel, Word,</strong> or <strong>PDF</strong> (see exhibit 3-34).
All reports that you select at the same time will be exported in one
file. In the Excel format, you will be able to increase the decimal
places (wherever more precision is available in the database).
Because there are many different operating systems in use, you may get
an error message with Excel or one of the other formats. Usually, this
will not affect your ability to export, so please wait for software
“errors” to resolve themselves.</p>
<p>Charts for each report will only be available on this menu if you saved
them by clicking <strong>Done</strong><br>
on the last screen after you created them. If a chart that you wish to
save or print is grayed out (not available for selection), cancel the
<strong>Export Reports</strong> tool, go back to the chart, and be sure to click
<strong>Done</strong> on the last screen. After that, it will be available for
export.</p>
