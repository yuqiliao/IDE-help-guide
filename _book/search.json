Two statistics options, standard deviations percentiles, generate reports proficiency levels reportable using statistical analyses. Proficiency levels subject analyzed scale subject; example, CIL proficiency levels analyzed overall CIL scale.\nComputer Information Literacy: Administered 2013 2018. years, CIL results reported using four proficiency levels (levels 1–level 4); IDE shows five categories (level 1, level 1, level 2, level 3, level 4).\nComputational Thinking: Administered 2018.
