<p>Your data query in the TALIS IDE begins on the <strong>Select Criteria</strong>
screen (see exhibit 6-2).</p>
<p>Select a <strong>Subject</strong> and <strong>Education level</strong> from the drop-down menus.
Once the screen resets, you can choose one or more <strong>Year</strong>,
<strong>Dependent Variable,</strong> and <strong>Jurisdiction</strong> for the data you wish to view or
compare. Use the <strong>Reset</strong> button, located in the upper-right portion of
the screen (just below the <strong>Help</strong> button), to cancel your selections
and begin again.</p>
<p>Click on a blue sideways-facing arrow (►) to open up a category, and
click on a blue downward-facing arrow (▼) to close a category.</p>

<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">6.1.2</span> Choose a Subject<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choose-a-subject"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>The first option you must choose in step 1, <strong>Select Criteria,</strong> is a
<strong>Subject</strong>. When using the TALIS IDE, you have the option to run either
a school- or teacher-level analysis. Click to open the drop-down menu
next to Subject, which provides the choice of selecting either
<strong>School</strong> or <strong>Teacher</strong>. Selecting the <strong>School</strong> option provides
school information that is an attribute of <em>schools</em> (thus estimates are
reported, for example, as the “percentage of schools”), while selecting
the <strong>Teacher</strong> option provides teacher or school information that is an
attribute of <em>teachers</em> (thus estimates are reported, for example, in
terms of the “percentage of teachers”).</p>

<p>The second option to choose in step 1, <strong>Select Criteria,</strong> is an
<strong>Education Level</strong>. TALIS collects data on ISCED 1 (Primary), ISCED 2
(Lower Secondary), and ISCED 3 (Upper Secondary). Please note that the
IDE default is ISCED 2.</p>
</div>
<div id="choose-years" class="section level3" number="6.1.4">
<h3>
<span class="header-section-number">6.1.4</span> Choose Year(s)<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#choose-years"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>To the right of the <strong>Dependent Variable</strong> and <strong>Jurisdiction</strong> tab titles, you
have the choice of selecting TALIS 2018, 2013, or 2008 data for analysis
by checking the appropriate box underneath the year listed. To include
data from all three years, check the “<strong>All Years</strong>” box to the left of
the individual years.</p>

</h3>
<p>After choosing a <strong>Subject</strong> and <strong>Education Level</strong>, you can then
choose a <strong>Dependent Variable</strong> within the <strong>Select Criteria</strong> tab. Note that the
Full Population Estimate is the default for selection, but instead of,
or in addition to, the Full Population Estimate, you can select from
among a number of continuous variables listed under Dependent Variable. You can
search for continuous variables using the <strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Sub
Category</strong> lists or by using the <strong>Search</strong> function. The continuous
variables are first organized by <strong>Category</strong> (such as Teacher and
Principal Characteristics, School Staffing and Resources, and Classroom
Climate), then organized by <strong>Sub Category</strong> (such as Principal
Demographics and Principal Work Experience). Finally, selecting a <strong>Sub
Category</strong> will display a list of continuous variables you may select to
use as a <strong>Dependent Variable</strong> in your analysis.</p>

<p>With your <strong>Dependent Variable</strong>(s) and <strong>Year</strong>(s) selected, next choose at least
one <strong>Jurisdiction.</strong></p>
<p>Jurisdictions are found under the following groups: <strong>OECD National
Entities</strong>, <strong>OECD Sub-National Entities</strong>, and <strong>Partners.</strong> There is
also a group category called <strong>International,</strong> with options to display
the <strong>Average of All Jurisdictions</strong> and the <strong>Average of the Selected
Jurisdictions.</strong></p>
<p>The general procedures for selecting one or more jurisdictions are as
follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>To open or close jurisdictions, click on the arrow. Jurisdictions in
the group are open and can be selected when the blue arrow points
down (see exhibit 6-3).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the checkboxes next to the specific jurisdictions that you are
interested in, or uncheck those jurisdictions that you wish to
deselect. If you click the checkbox next to the group name (e.g.,
“OECD National Entities”), you will select all the jurisdictions
within that group. If desired, uncheck the group name to deselect
all.</p></li>
<li><p>If you want to close a group (for example, close the list of OECD
countries), click the blue arrow next to the group name. The closed
group’s arrow points to the right. Be advised that closing the group
will not deselect your choices.</p></li>

<p>Step 2, <strong>Select Grouping Variables,</strong> can only be accessed after choosing
criteria at step 1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>.</p>
<p>To continue your data query and edit a report, <em>you must choose at least
one variable on this screen.</em> You can browse for variables using the
<strong>Category</strong> or <strong>Sub-category lists</strong> or by using the <strong>Search</strong>
function (see exhibit 6-4). You can return to this screen to change
variable selections at any time by clicking <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong>.</p>

</h3>
<p>On the <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong> screen, choose at least one independent
variable for your report. One way to do this is to search for
independent variables using the <strong>Category</strong> and <strong>Sub Category</strong> lists.
If you don’t wish to choose from any of the specified categories and
subcategories, then select <strong>All Cases</strong> in the <strong>Total</strong> sub category
(displayed as the default independent variable on the Select Grouping Variables
screen).</p>
<p>The variables shown are tied to the criteria you selected at step 1
(<strong>Subject, Education Level</strong>, <strong>Dependent Variable, Year,</strong> and <strong>Jurisdiction</strong>),
which are indicated at the top of the screen. To change any of these
criteria, return to step 1 by clicking on <strong>Select Criteria</strong>.</p>
<p>To browse for variables and get details about them:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click the blue arrows to open and close Category and Sub Category
lists of variables (see exhibit 6-5).</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>details</strong> or <strong>hide details</strong> to show or hide the full title
of a given variable, the TALIS IDE identification name (e.g.,
SC10012), and the values (i.e., variable labels). Note that some
variables have similar short titles, but comparing details will show
you how they differ. See the example in exhibit 6-5, which shows
<strong>School location</strong> and <strong>School location (2013)</strong>. The differences
between these two variables are further described in the details.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the checkbox next to a variable to select it for your
analysis/report. You will see the count increase next to <strong>View
Selected</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>View Selected</strong> tab to see the variables you have
chosen. To return to the full list of variables by Category and Sub
Category, click <strong>View all.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>Remember to select the year for which you wish to build a report and
make sure that data are available for your chosen year and
variables.</p></li>
<li><p>Searching for variables is an option from the <strong>Search</strong> box. See
<strong>Section Select Grouping Variables using the Search Function</strong> for more details about this function.</p></li>

<p>The second way to search for variables is to use the <strong>Search</strong> function
on the <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong> screen.</p>
<p>Type a term in the <strong>Search</strong> box and click <strong>Go</strong> (or hit “Enter” on
your keyboard) to find variables by keywords in the variable title
and/or details for the variable (see exhibit 6-6). The search function
operates on whole words or on an exact phrase (if it is contained in
quotes). To search for less than a whole word or exact phrase, include
an asterisk (*) after the search term. If you use multiple keywords,
“and” is assumed. You can narrow your search by using “or,” “not,” or
“and not.”</p>

<p>You can access step 3, <strong>Edit Reports,</strong> only after choosing criteria at
step 1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>, and then choosing variables at step 2,
<strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong>. The IDE will automatically build reports based on
your selections from steps 1 and 2. However, at step 3, you may modify
your selections for each report.</p>
<p>At this step, you can</p>
<ul>
<li><p>preview and edit the layout of your reports;</p></li>
<li><p>copy reports or create new reports based on the variables selected;</p></li>
<li><p>change formatting options, such as year order or number of decimal
places to display for all reports (these may also be changed in
individual reports, but format options can overwrite previous
edits);</p></li>
<li><p>change statistics options, such as average scores and percentages,
for all reports (these may also be changed in individual reports,
but statistics options can overwrite previous edits). Please note
that no more than two statistics can be included in every report;</p></li>
<li><p>select reports to be built into tables and charts at step 4, <strong>Build
Reports</strong>; and</p></li>
<li><p>delete reports.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Using your chosen criteria, the TALIS IDE will return a separate data
report for each variable you have chosen. If you have selected two or
three independent variables (not counting <strong>All Cases</strong>), you will also
see a <strong>cross-tabulated report</strong> for these variables (see exhibit 6-7). If
you have chosen four or more variables, you will get data reports for
each variable, but a cross-tabulation report will not be produced. If
you have selected more than one <strong>Dependent Variable</strong> (e.g., a continuous variable
from step 1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>), a separate set of data reports will
be generated for each <strong>Dependent Variable</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Edit Reports</strong> step (see exhibit 6-7) shows detailed information on
the layout of your reports.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Report</strong> column indicates the report, or cross-tabulation
report, number based on the variable(s) chosen during the criteria

default, the report is named Report 1, Report 2, etc., or
Cross-Tabulated Report 1, Cross-Tabulated Report 2, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Select a dependent variable. You can choose a dependent variable if more than one was
selected at step 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Select which jurisdictions, grouping variables, years (if applicable), and
statistics to include (out of the selections previously made at step
1, <strong>Select Criteria,</strong> and step 2, <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong>). You can
select up to two statistics options from the following: <strong>averages,
percentages, percentiles</strong> and <strong>standard deviations.</strong> (For further
information, see <strong>Section Statistics Options</strong>.)</p></li>
<li><p>To create a new variable while editing a report, click on <strong>Create

<li><p>Select the variable for which you wish to combine values (see
exhibit 6-10).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the values you want to combine by checking the boxes to the
left of the value.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a name for the new value, and press <strong>Create</strong>. The collapsed
values will appear in gray to indicate that they have already been
used. The variable named can only be 25 characters long.</p></li>
<li><p>Wait for the screen to refresh, and press <strong>Done.</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The new variable will appear in the <strong>Grouping Variable</strong> list in the <strong>Edit
Report</strong> window or <strong>Create New Report</strong> window, designated as
“collapsed” (see exhibit 6-11). Check the box next to the new variable to
view it in the report. You can click <strong>Preview</strong> to see how the table
will be laid out before retrieving data.</p>

</div>
<p>A new variable that you create is applicable <em>only</em> to a specific
report; it does not apply to the other reports listed on the <strong>Edit
Reports</strong> screen.</p>
<p>For example, if you selected multiple dependent variables of teacher and principal
characteristics for analysis, then you would need to create the new
variable for <em>each</em> dependent variable or create a copy of the report and edit it
accordingly. To do the latter, click on <strong>Copy</strong> report on the <strong>Edit
Reports</strong> screen (copied reports appear at the end of the list of
reports) and then, for the new copy, click on <strong>Edit</strong> (using the above
example, you can change the dependent variable and give the report a new name).</p>
<p>You can repeat the process and combine different values of a variable to
create additional new variables. Using the <strong>Create New Report</strong>
function, you can create a new report for each new variable that you
create. (For further information, see <strong>Section Create New Report</strong>
below.)</p>
<p>If you selected two or three variables from which to create new
variables, you can repeat the process for each of them. Using the
<strong>Create New Report</strong> or <strong>Edit Report</strong> function, these collapsed
variables will be listed and available for cross-tabulation (see exhibit
6-11). If you have chosen four or more variables (not counting <strong>All
Cases</strong>), you won’t get the cross-tabulation. You can click <strong>Preview</strong>
to see how the table will be laid out before retrieving data.</p>

listed. The following formatting options are available using this
function (see exhibit 6-13):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Variable Labels (Long)</strong> displays a more detailed description of
the variables selected in a query than the default short label. For
variables from questionnaires, the full text of the question is
displayed. Be advised that the length of the extra detail may
sometimes interfere with table formatting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Show data for values categorized as “missing”</strong> will include the
percentage of students in the total sample or in a reporting group
for whom membership in a particular response category is unknown
because no response was given by the students, their teacher, or
their school. The percentage of “missing” will be shown in the

<li><p><strong>Year Order</strong> will order the data tables in each report built, with
either the most current year of data, or the oldest year of data,
displaying first.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decimal Places</strong> gives you the option of specifying a lower level
of precision for a particular statistic (none or one decimal place)
than does the default, which displays averages and percentages to
two decimal places. Also, standard errors will be shown to one more
decimal place than is shown for a particular statistic. For example,
if you request that average scores be displayed to one decimal
place, the corresponding standard errors will be displayed to two
decimal places. If you export to Excel, you will be able to increase
the number of decimal places in most cases.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Include</strong> gives you the option of showing standard errors. By
default, standard errors are shown inside parentheses, but you have

<strong>Statistics Options</strong> allows you to designate up to two statistics. The
selections you make are applicable to all the reports listed, although
you can also change the statistics for an individual report when you
edit it. (For further information, see <strong>Section Edit Report</strong>.)</p>
<p>The following statistics options are available (see exhibit 6-14):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Averages.</strong> For the TALIS assessment, teacher and principal
averages for continuous variables are in the same units as the
variables themselves (e.g., average age of teachers). By default,
the standard errors of the averages are shown in parentheses.
Averages will only display in the TALIS IDE if you have selected a
continuous variable from step 1, <strong>Select Criteria</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Percentages.</strong> This statistic shows the percentage of teachers or
schools as a row percentage. For example, if the first column lists
countries or subnational education systems, then each country or
subnational education system will display its own percentage
distribution across its row. By default, percentage distributions do
not include missing data. For information on how to show data for
values categorized as missing, see <strong>Section Format Options</strong>.</p></li>
<li>
<p><strong>Percentiles.</strong> This statistic shows the threshold (or cut-point)
score for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>10<sup>th</sup> percentile – the bottom 10 percent of schools or teachers</p></li>
<li><p>25<sup>th</sup> percentile – the bottom quarter of schools or teachers</p></li>
<li><p>50<sup>th</sup> percentile – the median (half scored below the cut-point and half scored above it)</p></li>
<li><p>75<sup>th</sup> percentile – the top quarter of schools or teachers</p></li>
<li><p>90<sup>th</sup> percentile – the top 10 percent of schools or teachers</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Standard deviations.</strong> The standard deviation is a dependent variable of how
widely or narrowly dispersed scores are. Under general normality
assumptions, 95 percent of the scores are within two standard
deviations of the mean. For example, if the average score is 35
and the standard deviation is 5, it means that 95 percent of the
scores fall between 30 and 40. The standard deviation is the
square root of the variance.</p></li>

<p>As previously noted, the selections you make in <strong>Statistics Options</strong>
will be applied automatically to all reports, although you can change
the statistics for an individual report if you use the <strong>Edit</strong> command
in the <strong>Action</strong> column. Be advised that if you use <strong>Statistics

a report with a different selection of statistics, consider using the
<strong>Create New Report</strong> function to generate a new report with different
statistics. (For further information, see <strong>Section Create New

<p>Not all statistics are available for all reports. Their availability
depends on other selections you have made to define the content and
format of your report.</p>
<p>NOTE: The statistics produced by the IDE may not match the statistics in
reports published by the OECD, due to differences in certain statistical

</h3>
<p>Tests for statistical significance indicate whether observed differences
between assessment results are likely to have occurred because of
sampling error or chance. “Significance” here does not imply any
judgment about absolute magnitude or educational relevance. It refers
only to the statistical nature of the difference and whether that
difference likely reflects a true difference in the population.</p>
<p>With your report of interest selected, click the <strong>Significance Test</strong>
link, which is located to the right of the <strong>Chart</strong> link (see exhibit
6-16). You first need to decide which variable you want to test and the
criterion by which you want to test it (i.e., between jurisdictions,
within variables, or across years). You will compare or “look across”
the variable’s range of values, so it must have more than one value. You
can look across jurisdictions for a variable (that is, compare between
two or more jurisdictions) or you can look across the values within a
variable for a single jurisdiction. Once the primary criterion is chosen, all other criteria must
be restricted to a single value.</p>
<p>The general steps for running significance tests are as follows (see
exhibit 6-23):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the <strong>Significance Test</strong> window, select either <strong>Between
Jurisdictions</strong>, <strong>Within Grouping Variables</strong>, or <strong>Across Years</strong>. Then,
select the appropriate jurisdiction(s), variable(s), year(s), and
statistic(s). For <strong>Between Jurisdictions</strong>, select at least two
jurisdictions. For <strong>Within Grouping Variables</strong>, select one or more
jurisdictions. For <strong>Across Years</strong>, more than one year needs to be
selected.</p></li>
<li><p>Enter a <strong>Name</strong> limited to 25 characters, using only letters,
numbers, spaces, underscores, and hyphens (otherwise, by default,
the test is named “Sig Test 1”).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the output type as either <strong>Table</strong> or <strong>Map</strong>. The table
option will show the significance test results as a matrix. The map
option will show the significance test results on a world map,
highlighting the countries and subnational education systems that
have been selected. The map output is only available when <strong>Between
Jurisdictions</strong> is selected in the first step.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional options allow you to select <strong>Show Table Details</strong> to
display the estimates and standard errors for the table cells. If
you selected a map, this option is not applicable, as the map will
automatically show statistical details.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Preview</strong> tab located in the upper-left corner, or the
<strong>Preview</strong> button located in the bottom-left corner.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> tab in the upper-left corner of the screen if you
wish to go back and make changes to the selections you made for
running the significance tests.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Done</strong> button in the upper- or lower-right corner of the
screen to run the significance tests.</p></li>

</div>
<p>When the table option is selected, you will get a significance test
matrix in which you will see the differences and <em>p</em> values. Using the
symbols shown in the legend of the matrix, an indication is also
provided of whether one estimate is significantly lower or higher than
another estimate or whether there is no significant difference (see
exhibit 6-24).</p>
<p>The alpha level for all <em>t</em>-tests is .05. All comparisons within a jurisdiction, within the same year, are made using dependent <em>t</em>-tests. Comparisons between jurisdictions are treated as independent. Comparisons across years are treated as independent. A part-whole adjustment is implemented for comparisons between a jurisdiction and a group that the jurisdiction is part of (e.g. Average of All Jurisdictions).</p>

</div>
<p>When the <strong>map option</strong> is selected, a global map is shown with the
countries and subnational education systems selected shaded (see exhibit
6-25). The focal jurisdiction is shaded in teal green, with all other
countries compared to it. The other countries are shaded in colors that
indicate whether they are higher, lower, or not significantly different
from the focal jurisdiction on whatever dependent variable has been selected. Note
that a light shade of gray is the default color for jurisdictions not
selected for comparison.</p>
<p>When you hover over a jurisdiction, a text bubble displays the numerical
difference in estimates between that jurisdiction and the focal
jurisdiction. At any point, you may choose a different focal
jurisdiction by clicking on another country. You may also choose a

<p>Gap analysis is included in the IDE to compare differences in gaps shown
in a table, map, or chart. Gap differences can be compared between
jurisdictions and/or across years.</p>
<div class="inline-figure">Exhibit 6-26. Gap analysis link selection
<img src="images/chapter6/image15.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.15556in" alt="Exhibit 6-26 is a screenshot from the TALIS IDE tool showing how to select the gap analysis function in the Build Reports tab.">
</div>
<p>With your report of interest selected, click on the <strong>Gap Analysis</strong>
link, which is located to the right of the <strong>Significance Test</strong> link
(see exhibit 6-26). You will need to decide which variable you would like
to test (e.g., principal job satisfaction, good teacher-student
relationships) and the criterion by which you want to test it (i.e.,
between jurisdictions or across years). The difference measure, or gap,
can be viewed <strong>Between Groups</strong>, <strong>Between Years</strong>, <strong>Between Groups
and Years</strong>, or <strong>Between Percentiles</strong> within the selected variable.
For example, if you compute the difference in administrative and
leadership tasks for principals from different age groups for two
countries, you can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>at one time point, compare the age group (e.g., ages below 40 and
between 40-49) gap in one country/subnational education system to
the age-group gap in another country/subnational education system;</p></li>
<li><p>compare the age-group gap at two time points within a
country/subnational education system;</p></li>
<li><p>compare the difference between the age-group gap at two time points
in country/subnational education system to the difference between the age-group
gap at two time points in another country/subnational education
system; or</p></li>
<li><p>compare the gap for ages below 40 at two time points in one
country/subnational education system to the gap for ages below 40 at
two time points in another country/subnational education system.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
<p>The steps for running a gap analysis (exhibit 6-27) are similar to those
for conducting a statistical significance test. Thus, to run a gap
analysis, follow the instructions under <strong>Section Significance
Tests</strong>, noting the following differences:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>Gap Analysis</strong> link should be selected, not the <strong>Significance
Test</strong> link.</p></li>
<li><p>The gap analysis does not have a <strong>Within Grouping Variables</strong> option for
analysis; the options are <strong>Between Jurisdictions</strong> and <strong>Across
Years.</strong></p></li>
<li><p>The difference measure (gap) of analysis must be selected from the
following: <strong>Between Groups, Between Years, Between Groups and
Years,</strong> and <strong>Between Percentages</strong> (if variables are selected for
which a difference measure is not feasible, the difference measure
option will not appear as available in the <strong>Gap Analysis</strong> menu).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The gap analysis output is presented in a format similar to that of the
significance test output, with one difference: the difference estimate
shown in the output is the difference between the gaps selected for
analysis. Note that you will still see the significance of these
differences, just like in a significance test. For example, exhibit 6-28
shows cross-national differences in the percentage gaps between two age
groups (principals who are below 40 and who are 60 and above).</p>
<p>The gap analysis function computes and statistically tests differences
between average, percentage, or percentile gaps. Note that the reference
group for the gaps is kept constant during the analysis, as opposed to
taking the absolute value of the gaps. Therefore, the gap analysis tests
whether the magnitude of the gaps differ from each other only when the
gaps go in the same direction.</p>
<div class="inline-figure">Exhibit 28. Gap analysis output

</div>
<p>NOTE: A gap analysis across years cannot be combined with the <strong>Between
Years</strong> or <strong>Between Groups and</strong> <strong>Years</strong> difference measures, so you
will select the difference measure <strong>Between Groups,</strong> or, if you have
selected percentiles as one of your statistics, you may choose <strong>Between
Percentiles.</strong></p>

</h3>
<p>Regression analysis is included in the IDE to test for trends across
more than two data points. The type of analysis performed in this
feature of the IDE is referred to within the field of statistics as
linear regression. To run a regression, first go to <strong>Build Reports</strong>
and choose the report of interest from the drop-down <strong>Select Report</strong>
menu. Then click on the <strong>Regression Analysis</strong> link, which is to the
right of the <strong>Gap Analysis</strong> link (see exhibit 6-29).</p>

</div>
<p>The general steps for running a regression analysis are as follows (see
exhibit 6-30):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the <strong>Regression Analysis</strong> pop-up window, enter a <strong>Name</strong>
limited to 25 characters, using only letters, numbers, spaces,
underscores, and hyphens (otherwise, by default, the test will be
named “Regression 1”).</p></li>
<li><p>Select the appropriate jurisdiction, year, and variable(s) for
analysis. Please note that you may only choose one jurisdiction and
year at a time to be in your report, but you may choose up to three
variables. In order to use up to three variables, you must have
already created and selected a cross-tabulated report (by selecting
three variables in Step 2, <strong>Select Grouping Variables</strong>).</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Preview</strong> tab located in the upper-left corner to view
the table format into which your output will be populated. In the
Preview tab, an “X” denotes where the output will display.</p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Done</strong> button in the upper- or lower-right corner of the
screen to run the regression analysis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> tab in the upper-left corner of the screen if you
wish to go back and make changes to the selections you made for running
the analysis.</p>
<div class="inline-figure">Exhibit 6-30. Regression analysis options
<img src="images/chapter6/image25.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.42292in" alt="Exhibit 6-30 is a screenshot from the TALIS IDE tool showing the options for the regression analysis output.">
</div>
<p>After you have clicked <strong>Done</strong>, your regression analysis output will
load onto the screen (see exhibit 6-31). A 0-1 contrast coding is used to
code the independent variable, where the first subgroup of the
independent variable is the reference group. Using dummy-coded variables
in a linear regression is useful for comparing each subgroup against a
reference group. For example, in exhibit 6-31, the reference group for the
independent variable <strong>Principal Age Groups (</strong>SC10003<strong>)</strong> is the
subgroup “Below 40,” and it is coded as 0. Except for the reference
group, each subgroup (e.g., ages “40-49,” “50-59,” and “60 and above”)
is contrast coded in a separate dummy variable (code 1) against all the
other subgroups of the variable (coded 0).</p>
<div class="inline-figure">Exhibit 6-31. Regression analysis output
<img src="images/chapter6/image26.png" style="width:6.5in;height:3.26597in" alt="Exhibit 6-31 is a screenshot from the TALIS IDE tool showing an example of the regression analysis output.">
</div>
<p>Using the output from exhibit 6-31, you can compare the mean percentage of
principals below age 40 to the mean percentage of those age 40 and
above. When a single dummy-coded variable is used in a regression, the
<em>intercept</em> is the mean of the reference group (e.g., 40.3598), and the
<em>regression coefficient</em> is the difference between the mean of the
reference group and the group identified (coded 1) with the dummy-coded
variable (e.g., -19.6928 for 40 to 49 years old). Since the regression
coefficients are presented with a standard error and a <em>t</em> value, they
can be used to test whether a difference between means is statistically
significant. Under the <strong>Significance</strong> column in the output, you will
see three possible signs: (1) &lt; signifies a significant negative
difference, (2) &gt; signifies a significant positive difference, and (3)
x signifies the difference is not significant.</p>

the <strong>Export Reports</strong> window are those that were checked off at step 3,
<strong>Edit Reports</strong>.</p>
<p>Check the files you want to export, and select one of the file formats:
<strong>HTML</strong> (print-friendly), <strong>Excel, Word,</strong> or <strong>PDF</strong> (see exhibit 6-32).
All reports that you select at the same time will be exported in one
file. In the Excel format, you will be able to increase the decimal
places (wherever more precision is available in the database).
Because there are many different operating systems in use, you may get
an error message with Excel or one of the other formats. Usually, this
will not affect your ability to export, so please wait for the software
errors to resolve.</p>
